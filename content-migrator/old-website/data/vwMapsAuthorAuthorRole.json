    "description": "Francis Narin, Principal Investigator of the TRACES study at IITRI, founded CHI Research in Chicago in 1968 to develop and serve “indicator services” for government and private clients. CHI Research went on to become a leading bibliometrics research firm for the next 35 years, pioneering the application of bibliometrics to science indicators, patent citation analysis, the linking of patents and papers, and the linkage between quality patents and stock market performance. The tracing shown here was developed by George Benn under the direction of Narin. It was part of the TRACES study entitled <em>Technology in Retrospect and Critical Events in Science</em>, funded by the National Science Foundation. Key events that led to the development of the video tape recorder were identified by knowledgeable research scientists and classified into three categories: non-mission research (red circles), mission-oriented research (blue triangles), and development and application (green squares). They were then organized in time, grouped, and interlinked. The resulting map is a first attempt to quantify the types of events and time lags that occur in the entire R&D process, from basic (non-mission) research to the commercial availability of a product. Most notable are the six different streams of knowledge that had to converge to produce the video tape recorder. ",

    "description": "R. Buckminster Fuller, the noted visionary and applied futurist, was one of the first to chart long-term trends of industrialization and globalization as early as the 1930s. In 1961, Fuller made a proposal to the International Union of Architects at their VIIth Congress to encourage architectural schools around the world to commit the next ten years to addressing how to make the world’s total resources, which then served only 40% of the world population, serve 100% of humanity. This was the beginning of a World Design Science Decade (WDSD), an international program to apply his strategies for Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science. The program itself never took off; however, the documents themselves reveal early ecological thinking in the 20th century. This trend chart from Document 6, produced by Fuller and his associate John McHale, shows how the confluence of human communication and transportation technologies produce a “shrinking Earth.” During the same decade that Gordon E. Moore predicted the acceleration curve of computing technologies (Moore’s Law), Fuller applied his comprehensive approach to map the global impact of what he termed “accelerating acceleration” and “ephemeralization” (tendency to develop smaller and more efficient technologies).

Unlike most works of art, his maps do not depict the hypothetical or imaginary but are rendered based on facts from mainstream publications like the <em>New York Times, Washington Post,</em> and <em>Los Angeles Times</em>. Lombardi carefully organized these facts in a handwritten database of over 14,000 cross-referenced index cards. He iteratively composed his “narrative structures” in his medium of choice: colored pencil and graphite on paper. This map shows the fifth version of a chart that focuses on the conjunction of illegal arms dealing by Chinese nationalists in Los Angeles and possible White House campaign-finance corruption. Two layers of information are presented: essential elements of the story in black, and major lawsuits, criminal indictments, and other legal actions taken against the parties in red. Interconnections of different types are revealed: a solid arrow represents influence or control; a double arrow, mutual relationship or association; a dashed arrow, flow of money, loans, or credits; a squiggle, the sale or transfer of an asset; and a double hyphen, a blocked or incomplete transaction.

In collaboration with information scientist Katy Börner and graphic designer Elisha F.

Patents granted between January 1, 1976, and December 31, 2002, were obtained from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) patent archive. A simple graph shows the 140% increase in the number of patents granted over the last 25 years. The 2.5 million patents are further grouped by their classification, and changes in the number of patents per class were examined in five-year intervals. Classes that experienced slow or rapid growth are depicted and contrasted using treemaps, a space-filling technique developed at the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at the University of Maryland. To compare the evolving patent holdings of Apple Computers and a private patent holder, treemaps were placed in a time sequence. Longitudinal comparison at the classification level becomes possible, revealing an assignee’s past and current intellectual borders, patenting behavior, and maybe even a general understanding of research and development trends.

Boyack and Katy Börner, this map shows the structure and dynamics of the English Wikipedia based on 659,388 articles and their editing activity. The similarity of each article-article pair was calculated as the number of shared links to other articles. The resulting similarity matrix was read into VxOrd to generate the base map layout. An invisible 37 x 37 half-inch grid was drawn underneath the network and filled with relevant images from key articles. Overlaid are 3,599 math, 6,474 science, and 3,164 technology articles. They are color-coded in blue, green, and yellow, respectively, with all other articles appearing in grey. Exactly 8,181 articles are in one category, 2,348 in two, and 73 in all three categories. The four corners show smaller versions of the map with articles size-coded according to article edit activity (top left), number of major edits from January 1st, 2007, to April 6th, 2007 (top right), number of bursts in edit activity (bottom right), and the number of times other articles link to an article (bottom left).

    "description": "Daniel Zeller’s drawings depict abstract spaces with beauty and inspiring complexity. This drawing conceptualizes science as layers of interconnected scientific fields through a stimulating and creative visual language. Starting with the very first scientific thought, science grows outwards in all directions. Each year, another layer is added to the meteor-shaped manifestation of knowledge. New fields emerge (blue), and established fields (brown) merge, split, or die. The cutout reveals a layering of fat years that produce many new papers and slim years in which few papers are added. Each research field corresponds to a tube-shaped object. Some have very fast growth patterns due to electronic papers that are interlinked within days. Other fields communicate knowledge via books, and years might pass before the first citation bridge is created. Blue tentacles could symbolize the search for opportunities and resources, or activity bursts due to hype and trends. The injection of money (yellow) has a major impact on how science grows, while voids in our knowledge are potentially dangerous or inhabited by monsters. The trajectories of scientists who consume money, write papers, interlink papers via citation bridges, and fight battles on the front lines of research could be overlaid. Yet, scientists are mortal, leaving behind only the knowledge structures that future generations can build upon. ",

    "description": "Eugene Garfield, founder of the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), now Thomson Reuters, introduced “The Use of Citation Data in Writing the History of Science” in 1964. Forty years later, his HistCite™ tool automatically generates chronological tables and historiographs of topical paper collections. It assists researchers, librarians, and others in the following areas: identifying core papers on a topic in question; understanding the impact of specific authors, papers, and journals; and making sense of the history of old and new research topics. The HistCite™ tables support the interactive display and permit the sorting of papers chronologically as well as by journal, volume, issue number and page, and citation scores. Featuring graphic design by Elisha F. Hardy, concept and design from Katy Börner, images provided by Ludmila Pollock, and text from Jan Witkowski, this map compares, contrasts, and combines a modified version of Garfield’s manually created graph published in 1964 (left) with the HistCite™ graph automatically generated in 2006 (right). The 1964 graph shows the network of paper and citation linkages that led to the discovery of the DNA structure published by Watson and Crick in 1953. The HistCite™ graph plots major papers that cite Watson and Crick’s influential work. Find out more about the HistCite™ tool at <a href=\"http://histcite.com\">http://histcite.com</a>.",

    "description": "Interaction designer W. Bradford Paley approached making a map of science indirectly by creating a map of four out of five volumes of <em>A History of Science</em> by Henry Smith Williams. The first two volumes are organized in a strictly chronological fashion, so as the book wraps around the right side of the ellipse, it is organized as a timeline. The next two volumes distinguish two major domains—making two timelines—for more recent scientific exploration: the physical sciences (along the bottom left) and the life sciences (top left). Since the scattered words are pulled toward the places where they are used in the text (see the map itself for a better description of the layout), a particular structure emerges: names of individuals appear along the outside, as they are usually mentioned in only one or two places, and concepts that are common to science of all eras (e.g., system, theory, experiment) are pulled to the center, as they are mentioned everywhere. Even more fascinating, subjects that provide the main focus for certain areas are neither near the specific edges nor the general center, but in a local, topical band between the two: e.g., mind, knowledge, and conception during the philosophic beginnings of science; moon, Earth, sun, and stars somewhat later; electricity, light, and forces in the recent physical sciences; and animals, disease, development, and brain in the recent life sciences.

The TV shows the organization schema as a hierarchy in which sublevels are indented according to their depth in the hierarchy. Item properties are represented by bar graphs on the left-hand side of the schema. Item and class interrelations are denoted by line overlays.

Fuller frequently argued that in the universe there is no 'up' and 'down', or 'north' and 'south': only 'in' and 'out'. Gravitational forces of the stars and planets created 'in', meaning 'towards the gravitational center', and 'out', meaning 'away fom the gravitational center'.

The chart draws on a wide range of sources, including government statistics and the work of leading geologists such as Colin Campbell, whose oil depletion model forms the chart’s central image spanning most of the Oil Age, from 1859 to 2050. By displaying forecasts of oil’s peak and decline in the years ahead, the chart poses a difficult question: How will humanity deal with the inexorable depletion of one of its most valuable resources? To date, the chart has been distributed to every member of the U.S. Congress and donated to more than 2,500 teachers nationwide. ",

The chart graphically partitions the radio frequency spectrum—extending from 3 kilohertz (kHz) to 300 gigahertz (GHz)—into more than 450 frequency bands. Color-coding distinguishes the allocations for the 30 different radio services. This chart helps widely diverse audiences gain a general understanding of U.S. domestic spectrum allocation policies. The chart depicts the allocation decisions that were made by the NTIA and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) up to July 1, 2003; it replaces a similar chart printed by NTIA in 1996. U.S. domestic spectrum uses may differ from international allocations that comply with international regulations or bilateral agreements.

He often substituted mathematically proportioned images for dry and complicated columns of statistical data so that the first glance could “take it all in” and previously unforeseen comparisons could become apparent. The data map and time-series combination shown here was created in the last year of his life. It may be the best statistical graphic ever drawn. The map portrays the losses suffered by Napoleon’s army in the Russian campaign of 1812. The story begins at the Polish-Russian border with thick bands showing the size of the army in each position. The path of Napoleon’s retreat is depicted by the dark lower band, tied to temperature and time scales. Six variables and a dramatic series of human events are shown together in one comprehensive portrait. ",

His ideas about geography were similar to those of other scholars of the early sixteenth century. Except in one region. Sometimes the name that a mapmaker gives to a place takes on a life of its own, even when he later has second thoughts and wishes to change it. This is the case with Martin Waldseemüller, who made two world maps in 1507. One map was a small globe shown here, the other is a very large wall map (see 1507 Wall Map.)</p>\n\n<p>Both 1507 Waldseemüller maps are in the James Ford Bell Library Collection. The curators pose this question: \"A name that he added to these maps has appeared on world maps from 1507 to the present. Yet apparently Waldseemüller changed his mind about the suitability of the name shortly after he made these first maps. What name is it and why did Martin Waldseemüller change his mind?\"</p>",

    "description": "<p>This world is more earth-like than Pearl, having a vast world-wide ocean covering it from pole to pole. The map shows about one sixth of the planet. Like the map of Karishikar, this one also underwent damage by banana slugs, the entire left edge of the map shows quite a bit of the damage. The original is an octogon inscribed in 12 inch circle, done in colored pencil, paint and ink on parchment paper.</p>\n<p><strong>  Description of Unique Features:</strong>\nPearl gets its name from legends about its creation and an unusual geographic feature which lends credence to those legends. The legend has it that Pearl was once just that, a bead on the necklace of the creator goddess. The geologic feature is the Omphalos, the navel of the world, a vast bottomless pit centered on the rotational pole. It is believed that this pit passes all the way through the world and was where the threads went through to string the goddess' necklace. East, West, North and South have little meaning on Pearl because the habitable lands are centered on the pole (map).</p><p> The directions used by the inhabitants speak of poleward, and its opposite, oot, meaning towards the equator. These replace our north and south, but is the one pole the north pole or the south pole? Instead of east and west, they use clockwise and counterclockwise. Bear this in mind when reading the text descriptions of the images.</p>\n<p><strong>  Data Used:</strong>\nAn amazing piece of software, Bryce, allows me to make pictures that come much closer to what Pearl looks like in my mind than any of my previous drawings. Those drawings were never intended to be landscapes, but instead were hand-drawn maps which may have been created by inhabitants of those worlds. The map page has been very popular ever since I drew maps of Riven.</p>\n<p><strong>  Spatial Layout Techniques Applied:</strong>\nLocal explorations of Pearl have been my obsession of late, rendering image after image of the same scene at slightly different angles to produce a MYST-like walk-around. A few new concepts along these lines show up with names including the string, \"inch.\"</p>",

He was also the first cartographer to create an elegant map of England that correctly portrayed its shape. His style combined time-consuming embellishment with bold, clear lettering to highlight important information. Moll prided himself on his work and publicly rebuked mapmakers who republished preexisting maps under new titles without having investigated their accuracy or completion—as this could prove fatal in cases where known depths of water and sands were omitted. This map is a hand-colored, engraved double-hemisphere of the whole world, featuring California as an island, a popular misconception at the time. The continents are represented by 12 allegorical figures surrounded by plants native to these lands. The long note at the top left discusses the trade winds indicated by arrows throughout the map. ",

Two maps from this era became prototypes: the 1612 map of Virginia by John Smith and the 1651 map of New England by Jansson. Their general layouts were extensively copied from one mapmaker to another. This map is based on De Laet’s rare map of 1630 and is actually the third iteration of Jansson’s 1636 <i>Nova Anglia, Novvm Belgivm et Virginia</i>. This map was influential because it showed all of the current Dutch holdings from New England to Virginia. It is widely considered to be one of the first maps to use the names “Manbattes” (Manhattan) and “N. Amsterdam” (New York), which was founded less than 20 years prior. Europeans’ increased interest after 1600 in the colonization of North America is concisely shown here and developed partially because of this map. ",

    "description": "Maps organize information. Most pinpoint geographic locations relative to each other. The Map of Humanity also organizes information, but instead of doing it geographically, the map organizes the locations on the basis of moral, emotional, and cultural significance.\n\nThe continents of this restructuring rest upon the sea of the unconscious, the stormy basis of our thought. The land that emerges from it's broken into three main continents, each related to an aspect of the human mind: superego, ego, and id.\n\nThe superego is dominated by our higher aspirations. It is our moral centre, where our sense of compassion, love, and virtue reside. Hope, family, kindness, and beauty dwell here amongst the peaceful fields and tranquil cities.\n\nThe ego is dominated by reason, rational thought, and order. It is the land of science, where nature is harnessed by the human mind; and order and reason hold sway over emotion and passion.\n\nThe id is the dark continent, dominated by our primitive, animalistic urges. Here hate, greed, avarice, lust, and bigotry run rampant, and war devolves into atrocity. This is the world of our making, carved out of our actions, built upon the collective achievements of the human race.\n\nIt is an attempt to map the last six thousand years of human history and thought upon a theoretical geography to discover a sense of what kind of civilization humanity has attained. And like the geography of human nations, it is in constant flux, changing and growing as long as mankind walks the face of the earth.\n\nThe first version of the map was made as an intaglio print in 1993, but as all the locations had to be written out not only by hand but backwards by hand, the number of locations I could (and was willing to) include was obviously limited. In 2000 I felt I had a computer powerful enough to do a more ambitious, digital version. I pushed it till it reached the limits of what my computer could do, and this accounts for some of the odd errors on the map. That and my own poor spelling.\n\nAdmittedly, the scope of the idea is so vast it is unquestionably impossible to fully realize, but an interesting piece can still result from the effort. It is the journey that counts.\n\nA lot has happened since 2001, and eventually it will have to be updated again. There is lots to fix, lots to add, lots to update.\n\nThe Map of Humanity 3.0 I envision as a collaborative effort. This is my fantasy version, so big in scope as to be just silly. Well. Sillier, at any rate. A vast database of information would be assembled with the help of experts knowledgeable in mythology, literature, urbanology, and, well, everything. It would then be run through a computer program and plotted out. A fractal program could generate the coastlines. Some kind of clustering filter would have to be applied to the locations to get interesting landmasses out of the input. It could be updated every year or two. New land formations, new mountains, rivers, and roads would appear as events unfold, old ones wither away. Cities would change location as what they symbolize changes. I think that would be really neat.\nDescription of Unique Features:\nFrom the mythical cradle of human thought in the Garden of Eden, to the farthest reaches of human imagination, the map plots out mankind’s achievements, trials, and tribulations throughout history. We have constructed a world made up of our own actions and beliefs, as much as the one formed by the land we live on. The map of humanity is formed by our thought, our feelings, our dreams, and our nightmares.\nData Used:\nEverything I could get my hands on. Limited by my ignorance and laziness.\nData Analysis Techniques Applied:\nFlawed but ambitious.",

The very first map of all of science is shown here. A combination of fractional citation counting and co-citation clustering via multidimensional scaling was used to extract four nested levels of clustering via single and complete linkage. Major disciplines of science emerge from a bottom-up aggregation of highly cited papers. They are displayed in two dimensions, using an order-dependent, geometric triangulation process that produces a unified hierarchical arrangement of documents. Each circle contains a map of similar construction at a lower level of aggregation. Circle size corresponds to the number of citations received by documents in each cluster. Links among circles represent aggregate document co-citations. The original setup facilitated interactive exploration of the nested hierarchy of scientific disciplines. ",

    "description": "R. Buckminster Fuller, the noted visionary and applied futurist, was one of the first to chart long-term trends of industrialization and globalization as early as the 1930s. In 1961, Fuller made a proposal to the International Union of Architects at their VIIth Congress to encourage architectural schools around the world to commit the next ten years to addressing how to make the world’s total resources, which then served only 40% of the world population, serve 100% of humanity. This was the beginning of a World Design Science Decade (WDSD), an international program to apply his strategies for Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science. The program itself never took off; however, the documents themselves reveal early ecological thinking in the 20th century. This trend chart from Document 6, produced by Fuller and his associate John McHale, shows how the confluence of human communication and transportation technologies produce a “shrinking Earth.” During the same decade that Gordon E. Moore predicted the acceleration curve of computing technologies (Moore’s Law), Fuller applied his comprehensive approach to map the global impact of what he termed “accelerating acceleration” and “ephemeralization” (tendency to develop smaller and more efficient technologies).

The map was rendered as an equal-area cartogram, otherwise known as a density-equalizing map. The cartogram resizes each country according to its ecological footprint using a method developed by Gastner and Newman. The generally richer countries of Western Europe, Japan, and the United States have a large ecological footprint denoted by their large area size. Less developed yet highly populated countries such as India and China exhibit a similarly large footprint. Other countries such as Australia and Russia shrink compared to the land area map. The supplementary tables and chart show countries with the largest and smallest ecological footprints.

    "description": "Kevin W. Boyack and Richard Klavans are interested in creating high-quality maps of science that can be used as tools for planning and evaluation on multiple levels. In this work, Boyack and Klavans simplify their <em>Maps of Science: Forecasting Large Trends in Science</em> (featured in the third iteration of this exhibit) into a circular map. The 554 scientific disciplines, representing over 16,000 journals and proceedings, are placed in a logical order around the perimeter of a circle. The resulting “circle of science” is used as a reference system to show the scientific roots of technology. Over 18,000 inventor-authors from the Scopus publication and <em>United States Patent and Trademark Office</em> databases (2002-2006) were identified to link technological output (patents) from inventors to scientific output (papers) of authors. Authors are located within the circle map at the average position of their scientific papers using the disciplines in which they publish. Patents by these authors are then placed at the authors’ locations on the map. Some patents and classes are tied to one area of science (e.g., ‘G06F,’ near the edge), while others build on multiple areas of science (e.g., ‘C07D,’ near the center). Some areas of science (e.g., physics, computer science) are tied to large numbers of patents, while other areas of science (e.g., social sciences) are tied to very few patents. ",

    "description": "Kevin W. Boyack and Richard Klavans are interested in creating high-quality maps of science that can be used as tools for planning and evaluation on multiple levels. In this work, Boyack and Klavans simplify their <em>Maps of Science: Forecasting Large Trends in Science</em> (featured in the third iteration of this exhibit) into a circular map. The 554 scientific disciplines, representing over 16,000 journals and proceedings, are placed in a logical order around the perimeter of a circle. The resulting “circle of science” is used as a reference system to show the scientific roots of technology. Over 18,000 inventor-authors from the Scopus publication and <em>United States Patent and Trademark Office</em> databases (2002-2006) were identified to link technological output (patents) from inventors to scientific output (papers) of authors. Authors are located within the circle map at the average position of their scientific papers using the disciplines in which they publish. Patents by these authors are then placed at the authors’ locations on the map. Some patents and classes are tied to one area of science (e.g., ‘G06F,’ near the edge), while others build on multiple areas of science (e.g., ‘C07D,’ near the center). Some areas of science (e.g., physics, computer science) are tied to large numbers of patents, while other areas of science (e.g., social sciences) are tied to very few patents. ",

    "description": "The Center for Research Planning has spent over 25 years improving the modeling process first developed by ISI. For example, the map you see covers 38,000 research communities (a research community is a cluster of papers representing a group of researchers working on the same problem). The spatial relationship between the 38,000 research communities are from a proprietary visualization program developed for Strategies for Science & Technology. Network relationships between these 38,000 research communities are not shown but are available for client studies. These network relationships allow a manager to identify the high performance research that will impact their area of interest. This provides a unique and powerful way to identify emerging areas of science. Scientists can gain a deeper understanding of the context of their research activities. The map of science is especially useful for scientists who are interested in multidisciplinary research or research that draws from discoveries in related disciplines. Journal editors can map out the domains of their journal and utilize quantitative measures for journal strategy and performance. One can assess the ability of a journal to explore new topics that have higher performance characteristics. One can also assess the ability of a journal to abandon old topics that have lower performance characteristics. R&D managers can use the map of science to develop a science strategy for the firm. High impact threats and opportunities can be identified and assessed quickly and effectively. Quantitative indicators of organizational strengths are useful for self-assessments and identification of alliance partners. Corporate managers can use the map of science to communicate and evaluate a firm's science strategy. This high level view of science allows the executive to focus on the broader strategic issues. The ability to drill down for detailed information allows for an informed evaluation of the performance of a firm's science strategy.\n\nData Used:\nBibliographic data from peer reviewed articles from the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). \n\nSpatial Layout Techniques Applied:\nVxOrd (force-directed graph layout).\n ",

    "description": "Richard Klavans and Kevin W. Boyack share a deep interest in the mapping of science as a valuable tool for planning and evaluation on the national, corporate, and personal levels. The map featured here is based on the largest set of scientific literature mapped by 2007: 7.2 million papers and over 16,000 separate journals, proceedings, and series from a five-year period, 2001-2005. Groups of journals characterizing the disciplines on the map were defined using a metric based on a combination of the bibliographic coupling of references and keyword vectors. A three-dimensional layout of the disciplines (groups of journals) places those disciplines on a sphere, which is then unfolded using a Mercator projection to give a two-dimensional version of the map. A forecast of how the structure of science may change in the near future was generated by evaluating the change in the connectedness of various regions of the map over time. The structure of science is very likely to change in the future, and these maps can show us how. More information can be found at <a href=\"http://mapofscience.com\">http://mapofscience.com</a>.",

It assists researchers, librarians, and others in the following areas: identifying core papers on a topic in question; understanding the impact of specific authors, papers, and journals; and making sense of the history of old and new research topics. The HistCite™ tables support the interactive display and permit the sorting of papers chronologically as well as by journal, volume, issue number and page, and citation scores. Featuring graphic design by Elisha F. Hardy, concept and design from Katy Börner, images provided by Ludmila Pollock, and text from Jan Witkowski, this map compares, contrasts, and combines a modified version of Garfield’s manually created graph published in 1964 (left) with the HistCite™ graph automatically generated in 2006 (right). The 1964 graph shows the network of paper and citation linkages that led to the discovery of the DNA structure published by Watson and Crick in 1953.

It also helps with identifying classes that grew over-proportionally, evaluating the size and homogeneity of existing classes, and examining the “well-formedness” of an organization schema. The TV shows the organization schema as a hierarchy in which sublevels are indented according to their depth in the hierarchy.

    "description": "Kevin W. Boyack and Richard Klavans share a deep interest in the mapping of science as a platform for planning and evaluation on the national, corporate, and personal levels. Through a multistep process, this galaxy-like map of science was created from citation patterns in 800,000 scientific papers published in 2002. Each dot represents one of 96,000 active research communities. Over time, communities can be born, grow, split, merge, or die. By coupling coefficients between papers, using the VxOrd layout algorithm and a modified single-link clustering routine, Boyack and Klavans were able to calculate the placement of research communities. For example, communities made up solely of papers in biochemistry journals show up in the biochemistry section, while communities that are evenly split between biochemistry and chemistry journals show up midway between biochemistry and chemistry. In 2005, this was the most comprehensive and most accurate literature map ever generated.",

    "description": "I have kept every single piece of spam and virus email since mid-1997. Occasionally, it comes in handy, for example, to add naïve Bayesian spam filter to my custom-written email filter. And occasionally I use it to build a chart of spam and virus email. The following chart plots every single piece of spam and virus email that arrived at my work email address since April 1997. Blue dots are spam and red dots are email viruses. The horizontal axis is time, and the vertical axis is size of mail (on a logarithmic scale). Darker dots represent more messages. (Messages larger than 1MB have been treated as if they were 1MB.) Note that this chart is not scientific. Only mail which makes it past the corporate spam and virus filters show up on the chart. Why does so much spam and virus mail get through the filters? Because corporate mail filters cannot take the risk of accidentally classifying valid business email as spam. Consequently, the filters have to make sure to remove something only if they has extremely high confidence that the message is unwanted.",

It is typical in that it has all four elements common to concept maps used in the field of education: (1) nodes, (2) links, (3) connecting words that describe how the nodes are related, and (4) patterns (in this case a spatial ordering of the nodes suggesting their semantic proximity.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cognitive Principles or Metaphors Employed:</strong>\n\nExplicitly labeled connections. The linear connections are a powerful grouping principle that convey to the user the association between concepts. The fact that the connections are explicitly labeled allows the viewer to utilize both textual and spatial memory storage areas of the brain.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data Used:</strong>\nSampling of 13 class members.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spatial Layout Techniques Applied:</strong>\nMulti-dimensional Scaling ('MDS')</p>",

The circular title reintroduces the shape of the globe. This map is inspired by the international diversity if New York’s residents. New York is a global city in many respects. It is a major hub of the global economy, it attracts world-class talent, and it is a major tourist destination. But the diversity of its residents and their varied contributions make it truly distinct. Each country retains its distinct borders in forming the mosaic of Manhattan. The Global Island suggests that residents from all over the world can coexist, that they are integral to making the City what it is, and they can still retain their separate identities. Rather than a melting pot, the City is a rich mosaic, a microcosm of the world.\n\n<p><strong>  Data Used:</strong>\n\n2000 US Census data for citizenship, Tract level.</p>\n\n<p><strong>  Spatial Layout Techniques Applied:</strong>\n\nArcGIS Software was used to draw countries as data in decimal degrees at a scale of 1:50,000,000. A Census tract map of Manhattan was labeled with the derived citizenship data, drawn at a scale of 1:24,000. Both maps were exported into Adobe Illustrator for manipulation. Countries were placed near the Census Tract where most of their citizens were found, and spaced to fit in relation to the other country shapes.</p>",

More than 700 versions of the periodic table were produced in the century after Mendeleev. The table shown here was drawn by Murray Robertson based on scientific data provided by chemist John Emsley. In the interactive version available online, one may click on an element to provide chemical data and other relevant information.

    "description": "The <em>Interactive Sky Chart</em>, designed by Roger W. Sinnott and The Interactive Factory for <em>Sky & Telescope</em>, can simulate a naked-eye view of the sky from any location on Earth, at any time of night, on any date from 1600 to 2400. The circle seen here simulates the view of a dome centered over New York City in April 2006. The yellow rectangle represents the view looking into the southeastern part of the dome. The purple rectangle is a view into deep space. The stars and planets charted are those typically visible without optical aid under clear suburban skies. Deep-sky objects that can be seen through binoculars are also plotted. Observations over many centuries are used to predict which stars and planets will be visible from different areas at various times of the year. To specify a point on the Earth or celestial sphere, geometers use spherical coordinates. In the case of Earth, these are named latitude and longitude. Astronomers expand Earth’s coordinates out into the celestial sphere using coordinates called declination and right ascension that stay fixed with respect to the stars. This is why they can be permanently printed on star maps.

    "description": "In his 1987 book <em>Networks of Scientific Communications and the Organization of Fundamental Research</em> (in Russian), philosopher and sociologist Georgiy G. Dumenton analyzed personal scientific relations in a cluster of six tightly connected life sciences institutes of the USSR Academy of Sciences located in the Moscow region in the period between 1967 and 1979. The map shows one side of the two-sided appendix to the book comprising Figures 1-39 referred to in the text. Using data acquired via interviews, questionnaires, and participatory observation, Figure 3 shows continued (grey) and discontinued (black) personal scientific relations in the institutes M4 and M2. Relationships are ranked from the top to the bottom according to the duration of the relationship in years. The tail of the diagram, representing durations of 30 or more years, signifies almost life-long relationships. Dumenton also recorded motivations and interests for scientific relations and developed a typology of epistemic aspects of scientific collaborations. Figure 6 lists categories for evaluating scientific collaborations: e.g., evaluation of the researcher’s ideas and results; her/his methods; the state of equipment and other research instruments/technology; and the exchange of equipment and other research instruments/technology. Figure 5 shows correlations between these categories and their development over time. ",

    "description": "Developed by psychologist Johan Bollen, computer scientist Herbert Van de Sompel, mathematician Aric Hagberg, physicists Luís M.A. Bettencourt and Lyudmila Balakireva, software engineer Ryan Chute, and graph-systems consultant Marko A. Rodriguez, this is the first map created from large-scale, world-wide scholarly usage data collected by the MESUR project from some of the world’s most significant publishers, aggregators, and large university consortia. It visualizes the collective flow of how information seekers move from one journal to another in their online navigation behavior. As it reflects the actions of those who read the literature but rarely publish themselves, practitioner-driven domains appear larger than in citation-based maps. Most scientific domains, including the social sciences and humanities, are highly interdisciplinary, but the latter are more so as shown by the concentration of connections in that part of the network. Practitioner-driven domains such as nursing and tourism are strongly manifested in this map because they are highly populated with non-publishing, non-citing scholars that nevertheless read the relevant literature in their domain.

Thousands of pages of raw data are boiled down to the most open and accessible record of our nation’s spending. It is a uniquely revealing look at our national priorities that fluctuate yearly according to the wishes of the president, the power of Congress, and the will of the people. Over 500 programs and departments and almost every program that receives over $200 million annually are shown using a hierarchical tree map. Each node’s size is proportional to the size of funding it receives. This allows the viewer to quickly compare and contrast levels of spending and to easily identify government priorities. In addition to spending levels, percentage data is included to show an increase or decrease of funding in response to priorities for that current year. The poster was designed so that viewers could form their own opinions and derive their own answers—especially those that may differ from political rhetoric. ",

    "description": "The Council for Chemical Research (CCR) commissioned expert economists to conduct a two-phase study, published in 2005 as <em>Measure for Measure: Chemical R&D Powers the U.S. Innovation Engine</em>, on the quantitative impact of research and development (R&D) in the chemical sciences. Using patent and scientific literature, a 20-year timeline from basic research to market was determined. Furthermore, the experts identified two major feedback cycles: (1) chemical industry innovation is directly linked to federally supported foundational research, and (2) the $1 billion federal investment is leveraged by industry investment of about $5 billion dollars for invention development and technology commercialization. Experts also calculated that every dollar invested in R&D by the chemical industry over the past twenty years has generated two dollars in increased operating income, a 17% return on investment after taxes. In 2005, researchers from the Los Alamos National Laboratory examined the macroeconomic impacts of the $10 billion chemical industry income on gross national product (GNP) and jobs. Using the REMI Policy Insight model, they determined a GNP multiplier of 4 which, applied to the industry operating income of $10 billion, yields $40 billion in GNP; it also creates 600,000 new jobs and roughly $8 billion in additional tax revenues each year, some of which is invested in chemical R&D, thus closing the cycle.

    "description": "An expert in the area of technology forecasting, Joseph P. Martino created this map depicting the equilibrium of science and society. The graph on the left shows the number of scientists and the growth in population in the U.S. for nearly 30 years: 1940-1969. Martino calculated that the proportion of scientists in the population had increased from less than 0.5 percent to about 1%. Today, the U.S. has about 300 million people, including about 5 million (1.7%) scientists. On the right, the growth in the U.S. gross national product (GNP) since 1946 and the dollar resources expended in research and development (R&D) for 1953-1968 are shown. The proportion of the U.S. GNP devoted to R&D doubled, from slightly less than 1.5% to 3% over that time period. In 2008, the U.S. GNP was $13 trillion, with about $0.3 trillion (2.3%) spent on R&D. While the percentage of scientists in the total population increases steadily, R&D investment as a fraction of GNP appears to be constant and is declining in purchasing power. The primary purpose of this map is to indicate that science is transitioning to equilibrium, and science policy-makers must start thinking about how to cushion the shocks that will accompany such a transition.

    "description": "Charles Joseph Minard was a French civil engineer and a true pioneer in thematic cartography and statistical graphics. Altogether, he generated over 50 maps looking among others at differential price rates for the transport of goods and people. This is the seventh and final version in a series of maps showing the impact of the American Civil War (1861–1865) on the European cotton trade. The flows of raw cotton prior, during, and after the war are depicted as colored bands. The width of the bands represents the amount of raw cotton imported, with one millimeter representing 5000 barrels. Prior to the U.S. Civil War, most of Europe relied exclusively on the U.S. South as the sole source of this indispensable raw material (blue band). Export blockades during the war changed global trade patterns, instigating a fierce competition between the U.S. (blue band), India and China (orange band), and Egypt (brown band). Minard argued that “a sustained competition among the rival producers would be most useful for England and Europe.” In the mid-to-late 1800s, his influence and contribution to visually based planning was so influential that all Ministers of Public Works in France had their portraits painted with one of Minard’s maps in the background. One of Minard’s most famous maps, <em>Napoleon’s March to Moscow</em>, is shown in the first iteration of this exhibit. ",

The methodology is centered around the representation of each document as an n-dimensional vector of terms. These vectors are used to construct a neural network model of the geographic knowledge domain using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). The neural network model is then transformed into two types of information: (1) a landscape in which elevation indicates the degree to which a single, focused topic is addressed; and (2) multilevel text labels associated with regions in the visualization.

More than a medium, the net is a environment uniquely hospitable to many diverse media: programming and animation, video and audio, gameplay and community. Each individual artist picks up these threads and weaves them in novel combinations. The Idea Line is designed to let you follow these threads of thought yourself, and discover how each work is part of a larger tapestry. The Idea Line displays a timeline of net artworks, arranged in a fan of luminous threads. Each thread corresponds to a particular kind of artwork or type of technology. The brightness of each thread varies with the number of artworks that it contains in each year, so you can watch the ebb and flow of different lines of thought over time. As you move your mouse over the lines, they will open up to reveal titles of artworks. Place the mouse on top of a title to learn more about the work. Click to launch the work itself. Right-click (shift-click on a Mac) to highlight other pieces by the same artist. If you are looking for a particular title or artist, type into the text box at the upper left.

It uses the metaphor of geographic space to portray the route one must travel to win the affection of one’s love interest. The goal of the participant is to move from the bottom of the map to the top while avoiding such undesirable locales as the “Lake of Indifference,” the “Dangerous Sea,” or the “Sea of Enmity.”\n\nCognitive Principles or Metaphors Employed:\nNon-spatial stages of personal growth are displayed spatially using cartographic metaphors.",

    "description": "Maps organize information. Most pinpoint geographic locations relative to each other. The Map of Humanity also organizes information, but instead of doing it geographically, the map organizes the locations on the basis of moral, emotional, and cultural significance.\n\nThe continents of this restructuring rest upon the sea of the unconscious, the stormy basis of our thought. The land that emerges from it's broken into three main continents, each related to an aspect of the human mind: superego, ego, and id.\n\nThe superego is dominated by our higher aspirations. It is our moral centre, where our sense of compassion, love, and virtue reside. Hope, family, kindness, and beauty dwell here amongst the peaceful fields and tranquil cities.\n\nThe ego is dominated by reason, rational thought, and order. It is the land of science, where nature is harnessed by the human mind; and order and reason hold sway over emotion and passion.\n\nThe id is the dark continent, dominated by our primitive, animalistic urges. Here hate, greed, avarice, lust, and bigotry run rampant, and war devolves into atrocity. This is the world of our making, carved out of our actions, built upon the collective achievements of the human race.\n\nIt is an attempt to map the last six thousand years of human history and thought upon a theoretical geography to discover a sense of what kind of civilization humanity has attained. And like the geography of human nations, it is in constant flux, changing and growing as long as mankind walks the face of the earth.\n\nThe first version of the map was made as an intaglio print in 1993, but as all the locations had to be written out not only by hand but backwards by hand, the number of locations I could (and was willing to) include was obviously limited. In 2000 I felt I had a computer powerful enough to do a more ambitious, digital version. I pushed it till it reached the limits of what my computer could do, and this accounts for some of the odd errors on the map. That and my own poor spelling.\n\nAdmittedly, the scope of the idea is so vast it is unquestionably impossible to fully realize, but an interesting piece can still result from the effort. It is the journey that counts.\n\nA lot has happened since 2001, and eventually it will have to be updated again. There is lots to fix, lots to add, lots to update.\n\nThe Map of Humanity 3.0 I envision as a collaborative effort. This is my fantasy version, so big in scope as to be just silly. Well. Sillier, at any rate. A vast database of information would be assembled with the help of experts knowledgeable in mythology, literature, urbanology, and, well, everything. It would then be run through a computer program and plotted out. A fractal program could generate the coastlines. Some kind of clustering filter would have to be applied to the locations to get interesting landmasses out of the input. It could be updated every year or two. New land formations, new mountains, rivers, and roads would appear as events unfold, old ones wither away. Cities would change location as what they symbolize changes. I think that would be really neat.\nDescription of Unique Features:\nFrom the mythical cradle of human thought in the Garden of Eden, to the farthest reaches of human imagination, the map plots out mankind’s achievements, trials, and tribulations throughout history. We have constructed a world made up of our own actions and beliefs, as much as the one formed by the land we live on. The map of humanity is formed by our thought, our feelings, our dreams, and our nightmares.\nData Used:\nEverything I could get my hands on. Limited by my ignorance and laziness.\nData Analysis Techniques Applied:\nFlawed but ambitious.",

A total of 268,584 publication references and 60,876 Web links compiled on Sept 29th, 2008 was analyzed. The pie chart on the top left shows the different entity types within the BibTex encoded publication data. About 50% of the total publication records are articles. Below are top-20 counts for journals, author institutions, publishers, and books.</p>\n\n<p>The figure in the center shows the distribution of BibTex article data across the different sciences. The visualization uses the ‘UCSD Basemap of Science’ created by Boyack and Klavans (2007).</p>\n\n<p>The UCSD basemap is based on 7.2 million papers and over 16,000 separate journals, proceedings, and series from Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science and Elsevier’s Scopus database over a five year period, 2001-2005.</p>\n\n<p>Bibliographic coupling using highly cited references and keywords was applied to determine the similarity of journals. The final layout step was done using the 3D Fruchterman-Rheingold algorithm in Pajek; the results were so close to spherical (i.e., no nodes were in the middle) that all nodes were given a unit distance from the ‘center of mass’, resulting in a spherical layout. To ease navigation and exploration, a Mercator projection was applied to convert the spherical layout into the 2-dimensional map. Dots represent groups of topically similar journals. Links denote strong bibliographic coupling relations. Major areas of science are color coded and labeled. As every node on the map represents a set of journals, scholarly entities can be overlaid based on matching of journal names.\nEighty percent of the articles in over 3,000 journals can be located on the map. Most of the papers are in the social sciences and there is a strong focus on brain research, math, physics, electrical engineering, and computer science. Node size represents the number of papers  per node.</p>\n\n<p>On the right hand side are distributions in the data for records (meaning BibTeX entries and bookmarks), tags, articles, and users. The distribution of records by the number of tags they have is exponential, the distribution of articles by the number of authors they have is linear, and the distribution of users by the number of records they upload is exponential near the low end with a fuzzy power law tail. Each distribution is given with frequencies (blue diamonds) and ranks (pink squares). Exactly 24,831 records (only BibTeX entries; every bookmark has at least one tag) have zero tags while 230,363 have 1 and 75,421 have 2.

This examination of the archive by media artist Dietmer Offenhuber, information designer Moritz Stefaner, visualization consultant Evelyn Münster, software developer and researcher Jaume Nualart, and systems analyst Gerhard Dirmoser follows a three-step process. The first step involves a quantitative analysis of the total body of 37,432 Prix Ars Electronica submissions. The analysis shows the trends of the various sub-genres of media art, national preferences for specific genres, and the temporal evolution of the categories. The second step focuses on the jury process of the competition: the role of the jurors and their social connections in a network analysis, as well as the terminologies used in the written jury statements. The map reveals a tight-knit community and highlights the interdisciplinary connections across the field of media art. Finally, an art-historical citation network investigates how winning projects resonate in the context of scholarly literature and popular publications.

    "description": "Richard Klavans and Kevin W. Boyack share a deep interest in the mapping of science as a platform for planning and evaluation on the national, corporate, and personal levels. This map represents science as a set of fabrics in which scientific topics are woven by scholars over time. Just as a textile contains a perpendicular weaving of threads, this representation of the fabric of science consists of a perpendicular weave, with horizontal threads (temporal sequences of topics) and vertical weaving of those topics by leading researchers.

The result is a complex social and knowledge network that can be visualized as timelines, co-author maps, or topic landscapes. Shown here are four maps by communication design researcher Marco Quaggiotto of knowledge cartography research: an ‘Author-Topic Map’ that shows the network of key scholars and their research topics (left); a ‘Geographic Map’ that indicates where research on knowledge cartography is performed (upper right); a ‘Timeline’ of authors and publications where authors’ life spans are represented by horizontal lines, while publications and conferences are represented by icons (middle right); and a ‘Thematic Map of Disciplines’ contributing to this research (lower right). Each of the maps presents a partial and specific view of the knowledge space, presenting different aspects of the same reality.

    "description": "Sociologist and cyberneticist Loet Leydesdorff’s map shows the relatively rare event that multiple scientific specialties merge to form a new area of science, here Nanoscience and Technology. Using aggregated citations among journals obtained from <em>Journal Citation Reports </em>(JCR) of the <em>Science Citation Index Expanded</em>, the evolution of nanoscience and nanotechnology is animated for 1998-2003. During the late 1990s, journals in the field of applied physics increasingly cite <em>Nanotechology</em>. Thereafter, chemistry journals begin to publish relevant works. In 2000, <em>Science</em> plays a crucial role in the reorganization of (inter)disciplinary relations among relevant journals. Shortly thereafter, <em>Nanotechnology</em>, as a specialist journal, takes over the lead from <em>Science</em>. New journals emerge in the subsequent years, among them <em>Nano Letters</em>, published by the influential American Chemical Society since 2001. As could be expected, this latter journal takes the lead in terms of the number of citations it attracts and its impact factor. While the multidisciplinary journal <em>Science</em> continues to impact the fine-grained citation environment of the new scientific area, the journal <em>Nanotechnology</em> loses its catalyzing function at the interface of applied physics and physical chemistry.

Forty years later, his HistCite™ tool automatically generates chronological tables and historiographs of topical paper collections. It assists researchers, librarians, and others in the following areas: identifying core papers on a topic in question; understanding the impact of specific authors, papers, and journals; and making sense of the history of old and new research topics. The HistCite™ tables support the interactive display and permit the sorting of papers chronologically as well as by journal, volume, issue number and page, and citation scores. Featuring graphic design by Elisha F. Hardy, concept and design from Katy Börner, images provided by Ludmila Pollock, and text from Jan Witkowski, this map compares, contrasts, and combines a modified version of Garfield’s manually created graph published in 1964 (left) with the HistCite™ graph automatically generated in 2006 (right). The 1964 graph shows the network of paper and citation linkages that led to the discovery of the DNA structure published by Watson and Crick in 1953.

To visualize these scientific paradigms, Boyack and Klavans used the VxOrd graph layout tool to recursively cluster the 820,000 most important papers referenced in 2003, resulting in 776 paradigms. The most dominant relationships between paradigms were also calculated and are shown as lines between paradigms. The map of scientific paradigms constitutes a reference system that can be used for multiple purposes. Countries, industries, companies, and individual researchers can all locate themselves within the map, either as a single point or as a specific collection of paradigms. Science education and discovery can also be enhanced by linking to the map stories and facts that exemplify content and relationships between scientific paradigms. ",

The work is premised on the distance-similarity metaphor, in which objects more similar to each other are more proximate in space. Additional relationships are indicated by the direction of the labels. Ellingham’s map is one of the earliest known examples of a visual frontend to a body of literature.  Ellingham overlies the coverage of each of the available index and abstracting services in the United Kingdom onto the chart to indicate which areas of science the indexes covered. Overlay 1 features broad index and abstract services that cover large areas of science. Overlay 2 features more focused index and abstract services that cover specific areas of scientific research. Ellingham also intended that his two-dimensional map should be wrapped as if around a cylinder to show the continued relationships of topics on the extreme left side with those on the extreme right side.

Robison’s work addresses the following problem: while scientific literature is growing exponentially, and electronic databases make it easier for researchers to find the relevant literature, many researchers continue to use just one database. This map indicates what is potentially missed by the single-database approach when applied to a particular topic—in this case, the developmental disorder of autism. Four bibliographic databases were searched, and each retrieved publication was tagged and colored according to which databases contained it. While many publications are held by multiple databases, no single database has all the literature on a topic. Each database is unique in terms of journals included, years covered, and publication types. The differences are more pronounced with databases that go beyond journal articles to include conference proceedings, dissertations, and books. Moreover, even if the databases include the same contents, the search tools for each database perform differently, such as whether they automatically look for variants of the user's search terms. For a comprehensive search, multiple databases that complement each other's strengths need to be used. ",

He also develops analytical and interactive data visualization tools. The map shown here visualizes the localized stream of collaborations between researchers in different cities that are usually represented in a very symbolic or schematized way, aggregated at the country level. Elsevier’s <em>Scopus</em> was used to compute the number of all collaborations between city pairs from 2005 to 2009. The city names were then converted to geographic coordinates and projected on a plane using a Great Ellipse tracing algorithm that computes the shortest path between two points on Earth. Key aspects of the international science system can be rapidly gleaned from this visualization, such as the fact that Africa and South America collaborate often with the countries that had formerly colonized them. Most impressive is the density of collaborations within Europe and, to a lesser extent, within North America. This shows the impact of population density and highlights the need to examine collaboration data within, not just between countries.",

The map goes beyond the theoretic debates of database standards, formats, and software by depicting the actual configuration of existing data. Focusing on the connectivity of database entries, the map improves oversimplified—and, therefore, often wrong—indicators of data quality such as the raw number of records. Annotations in the map highlight a multitude of valuable insights that scholars can use to guide data access, management, and research. Similar maps can be produced for relational databases or linked open data in any domain.

It shows a bird’s-eye view of the hierarchical structure of over 2,800 terms for tagging resources. Most of the terms exist in English, Spanish, German, Italian, and Dutch. Starting from the most general term placed at the center, each path to the outside represents one “route of specialization.” Circle overlays indicate the number of associated resources for each concept, providing hints about the usage patterns of the taxonomy. For the subject matter experts in the project, visualizations like these have shown to be useful for quality control and iterative refinements of the taxonomy.

His work includes a series of diagrammatic paintings and graphical chronologies that illustrate the interweaving of historical narratives about art and culture. This map plots the science fiction literary genre from its nascent roots in mythology and fantastic stories to the somewhat calcified post-<em>Star Wars</em> space opera epics of today. Rather than a narrative emerging out of the data, here the narrative structure precedes and organizes the data: the movement of years is from left to right across the grid that represents time, distorted and reconfigured into the form of a bug-eyed monster whose tentacles are like trace roots to pre-historical sources and whose body is the corpus of sci-fi literature. Science fiction is seen as the offspring of the collision of the Enlightenment (providing science) and Romanticism, which birthed gothic fiction, source not only of sci-fi, but also of crime novels, horror, westerns, and fantasy (all of which can be seen exiting through wormholes to their own diagrams, elsewhere). Science fiction progressed through a number of distinct periods, which are charted, citing hundreds of the most important works and authors, and which includes film and television as well. ",

    "description": "Danny Dorling devised this project and gathered the data together, while Mark E. J. Newman wrote the computer software for making the cartograms and produced the figures themselves, and Graham Allsopp leant his cartographic expertise to many aspects of the project, particularly the poster design. In addition, Anna Barford wrote the text accompanying each map and sourced quotes, Ben Wheeler gave advice and checked for accuracy, John Pritchard developed the website and gathered data, and David Dorling contributed his medical knowledge to the production of technical notes. The map was rendered as an equal-area cartogram, otherwise known as a density-equalizing map. The cartogram resizes each country according to its ecological footprint using a method developed by Gastner and Newman. The generally richer countries of Western Europe, Japan, and the United States have a large ecological footprint denoted by their large area size. Less developed yet highly populated countries such as India and China exhibit a similarly large footprint. Other countries such as Australia and Russia shrink compared to the land area map. The supplementary tables and chart show countries with the largest and smallest ecological footprints. The map is one of more than 500 that make up the Worldmapper project at <u><a href=\"http://worldmapper.org\">http://worldmapper.org</a></u>.",

    "description": "Paul Marie Ghislain Otlet (1868-1944), a Belgian lawyer and internationalist, worked his whole life on the institutionalization of knowledge production and dissemination. In 1895, he and Henri La Fontaine created the International Institute of Bibliography in Brussels to support the elaboration of a universal bibliographic catalogue and related collections of images and documentary files. In 1910, they brought together collections in the Palais Mondial in Brussels with the idea to develop it into a global knowledge institution, comprising a World Museum, World Library, World University, etc.: The Mundaneum. Otlet envisioned Mundaneums in various cities over the world and a large network of local, regional, and national centers of knowledge production: Species Mundaneum.  The <i>Mondothèque</i> was one link in this hierarchical network. Otlet designed the <i>Mondothèque</i> as a work station to be used at home to engage people in the production and dissemination of knowledge. It contained reference works, catalogues, multimedia substitutes for traditional books such as microfilm, TV, radio, and finally a new form of encyclopedia, the Encyclopedia Universalis Mundaneum comprising reproducible “atlases” involving charts, posters, and other illustrative materials. The <i>Mondothèque</i> may be thought of as an analogue representation of today's ubiquitous computer-based digital functionalities.",

Given on the right is the UDC structure as a tree (all nine levels) of this widely used library classification system. The donut chart and bar chart in the middle show the alignment of the nine UDC main classes to the 43 main topic categories used by Wikipedia. All four visualizations use the same color-coding, making it possible to explore the dominance, distribution, and interrelations of topics. The work aims to increase our understanding of how knowledge maps differ when they are created socially (Wikipedia) as opposed to when they are created formally (UDC) using classification theory.",

Maps created from this data allow us to answer questions about where people congregate, for how long, and at what time of day. They show how people interact with the physical environment of the city. The research team of geographer and urban designer Sarah Williams, and architects Carlo Ratti and Riccardo Maria Pulselli developed a partnership with Vodafone, one of the largest European cell phone companies, to map this activity. Raw cell phone data for 2004-2005 is mapped here for Milan and illustrates urban dynamics that have never been accessible to policy experts at this level of detail. The hourly population estimates provide infrastructure planners with a way to infer urban density, thus helping them create better plans for public transport or roadway restrictions. City managers can use this real-time activity data to help create plans during emergency events. Urban designers can identify “good” spaces as it illustrates where people like to congregate. The triangulation techniques established to create these maps can be used to infer population data for developing countries where citizens use cell phones on a daily basis. ",

Approximately 60,000 grants are represented as dots, color-coded by NIH Institute. To generate the map, the content of each grant was assessed using topic modeling, an unsupervised machine-learning method based on statistics of co-occurring words in the grants’ abstracts. Grants were placed on the map using a layout algorithm that clusters together grants with similar topic mixtures. Clusters are labeled by the computationally derived topics with the highest word allocations in the underlying grants. The map provides a global view of the NIH funding: what topics of research are being heavily pursued, how the topics relate to one another, and what research topics interest each institute. Data can be examined at multiple levels (see zooms for ‘Cardiac Diseases Research’ and ‘Neural Circuit Research’ below) and at different resolutions (see funding portfolios of four institutes together with their top-10 topics on the right).

Burns, computer scientist David Newman, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) program director Edmund Talley. It is a similarity-based cluster map of all grants awarded by NIH in 2007. Approximately 60,000 grants are represented as dots, color-coded by NIH Institute. To generate the map, the content of each grant was assessed using topic modeling, an unsupervised machine-learning method based on statistics of co-occurring words in the grants’ abstracts. Grants were placed on the map using a layout algorithm that clusters together grants with similar topic mixtures. Clusters are labeled by the computationally derived topics with the highest word allocations in the underlying grants. The map provides a global view of the NIH funding: what topics of research are being heavily pursued, how the topics relate to one another, and what research topics interest each institute. Data can be examined at multiple levels (see zooms for ‘Cardiac Diseases Research’ and ‘Neural Circuit Research’ below) and at different resolutions (see funding portfolios of four institutes together with their top-10 topics on the right). The interactive version is shown on the left and can be explored at <a href=\"http://nihmaps.org\"><u>http://nihmaps.org</u></a>. ",

    "description": "The Earth is very old—about 4.5 billion years. Most of its history is preserved in the rocks that form the Earth's crust. The rock layers are like pages in a book—they record the events of the past, and some even contain remains of plants and animals. The age of a rock layer (or its “page number”) can be calculated via the molten radioactive elements that provide Earth with an atomic clock. This diagram was designed by Joseph Graham, William Newman, and John Stacy. It shows the evolution of Earth from 4.5 billion years ago to today. Time starts in the lower left corner and spirals upwards. Three billion years ago, organic structures emerged, and two billion years ago, early life forms appeared. The Cambrian explosion about 530 million years ago lead to a proliferation of life forms. Dinosaurs appeared during the Triassic period (230 million years ago) and became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates for 135 million years—from the beginning of the Jurassic (about 200 million years ago) until the end of the Cretaceous period (65.5 million years ago). They went extinct at the close of the Mesozoic era. Homo sapiens appeared 500,000 years ago and modern humans 200,000 years ago.

K-Web is the digital incarnation of Burke's award-winning books and television series on the history of innovation used in high schools and universities in fifty countries. It is a powerful, interactive, and intuitive exploratory time machine—a learning and teaching tool fostering multiple intelligences and complex thinking in more systemic ways. Using K-Web, anybody can understand knowledge in context, generate new ideas, and explore a universe of data to discover how seemingly unrelated people, events, and ideas are connected across time and space. It allows students to traverse human knowledge in a compelling way, to follow Burke on his unique guided tours of history, and to visit historical immersive interactive environments—e.g., talk to Galileo and experiment with his inventions. K-Web facilitates a new kind of education that is tailored to the interests and abilities of the learner.

    "description": "Manga is one of the most popular cultural forms today, enjoyed by children and adults around the world. Created by Lev Manovich, Jeremy Douglass, and Jay Chow of the Software Studies Initiative, <em>Manga Universe</em> shows 1,074,790 unique pages from 883 distinct manga series from Japan, Korea, and China. The series include both very popular long-running titles such as “Naruto” and “One Piece” and also many short-lived titles. The pages are organized according to contrast (horizontal axis) and by the amount of detail and texture (vertical axis). The pages in the bottom part have the least amount of detail, while pages in the top part have the most. The pages with the least contrast are on the left, while pages with the highest contrast are on the right. In between these four extremes, we find every possible stylistic variation. At the same time, we can see which graphical choices are more commonly used by manga artists (the central part of the “cloud” of pages) and which appear much more rarely (bottom and left parts). If you are a beginning manga artist and want to establish a unique style, you may want to position yourself in either of these areas, which so far have not been explored by other artists.

Eric Fischer majored in linguistics in college before becoming known for making maps, and he combined the two to make this map of Twitter activity around the world. Shown are geotagged tweets from May 14 to October 20, 2011, recorded using the Twitter streaming API. Each dot is a tweet. If there are many tweets at the same location, they diffuse outward but fade with distance. Dots are color-coded by language using Chrome's open-source language detector. English tweets are gray; other colors are optimized for maximum distinguishability. Labels on the right name those languages that have more than 10,000 tweets. No national boundaries are shown, yet a map of Europe emerges. The Netherlands has the highest density of tweets. In some areas, Twitter usage seems to follow the spines of the transportation networks—see central Spain and along the Trans-Siberian Railway in Russia. Overall, the map gives an indication as to the level of our social-networking obsession—some parts of the world are highly active while others are lost in the dark.",

    "description": "Randall Munroe’s <em>Movie Narrative Charts</em> displays the same mix of brainy humor, fanboy enthusiasms, and minimalist aesthetic that has made his webcomic, <em>xkcd</em>, such a phenomenon. The charts pictured here plot character trajectories from several popular films, using horizontal lines to track events in time and vertical arrangements to signify characters’ groupings and partings. The largest of the five charts, <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, has characters color-coded according to the major races of Middle Earth: hobbits, elves, dwarves, men, wizards, and ents. Smaller charts at the bottom use a similar approach to make witty commentary on their films’ plots. The unwavering parallel lines of the jurors in <em>12 Angry Men</em> reflect the deadlocked, claustrophobic atmosphere of this classic courthouse thriller, while the notoriously twisty plot of the cult film <em>Primer</em> is mimicked by its chart’s spaghetti ball of character development lines. To see more of Munroe’s slightly skewed and endlessly inventive creations, visit his webcomic’s site at <a href=\"http://xkcd.com\" target=\"_blank\">xkcd.com</a>.",

    "description": "Created by cartographer and designer John Nelson, this map visualizes over 160 years of recorded tropical storms and hurricanes by their paths and intensities, sourced from NOAA archives made available to the public. Mapping large volumes of this sort of recurring phenomena reveals clearer and stronger footprints of structure that may not be as apparent when presented individually. Inherent in the mapping, and highlighted via the polar projection, is the circuitous nature of cyclonic patterns as they spawn in warm tropical waters and rush away from the equator, carried along by climatic forces ultimately tied to the rotation of the planet itself. When viewed broadly in temporal volume and geographic scale, the cyclonic structure of individual hurricanes is echoed by a macroscopic view of this planetary phenomenon, forming one large “hurricane.” This fractal-like repeating pattern is a reminder of the repeating order found throughout the universe. In this case, a single rotational body, when seen at the right scale, forms a collective rotational body at the planetary level—a pattern then repeated at the solar system and galactic scales. The second and perhaps more salient message of this visualization is the evidence of increasing efforts and confidence in detecting and tracking these storms. The timeline plots the overall energy measured each hurricane season. The precipitous increase of detection in recent decades illustrates the narrative of important investments in the sciences—and the human dividends into which that investment has paid.",

This multipart data visualization tool was developed through an international partnership with the Polar Bear Specialist Group, a scientific collaboration of the five polar bear nations: Canada, Denmark, Norway, the U.S., and Russia. The most comprehensive online visualization of polar bear information to date, <em>State of the Polar Bear</em> provides a detailed look at each of the 19 polar bear subpopulations, and explores the factors that have influenced their International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) health-status ratings. The tool includes visualizations of abundance figures, harvest rates, circumpolar pollution levels, the shrinking Arctic sea ice, and other factors. In the next version of this tool, visitors will also be able to watch over two dozen videos of the world’s top scientists explaining the key issues that threaten the survival of this iconic species.

    "description": "Brian Castellani is a professor of sociology and an expert in the field of complexity studies. His map is a macroscopic, transdisciplinary introduction to the complexity sciences spanning 1940-2015. Moving from left to right, it is read in a roughly historical fashion, evolving along the field’s five major intellectual traditions: dynamical systems theory (purple), systems science (light blue), complex systems theory (yellow), cybernetics (grey), and artificial intelligence and cognitive science (orange). Placed along these traditions are the key scholarly themes and methods used across the complexity sciences.  A theme’s color identifies the historical tradition with which it is best associated, even if a theme is placed on a different trajectory. Themes in brown denote discipline-specific topics, which illustrate how the complexity sciences are applied to different content. Double-lined themes denote the intersection of a tradition with a new field of study, as in the case of visual complexity or agent-based modeling. Connected to themes are the scholars who founded or pioneered work in that area. Since 2009, the map has been extensively revised, based on successive, in-depth reviews of the scholarly literature, citation analyses, expert critique, summaries of various areas, and feedback from readers. To take a more in-depth, web-based tour of the traditions, themes, and scholars in the complexity sciences, explore the online version of the map at <a href=\"http://www.art-sciencefactory.com/complexity-map.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.art-sciencefactory.com/complexity-map.html</a>.",

    "description": "Created by computer scientist Nees Jan van Eck, information scientist Ludo Waltman, and interaction designer Ferdy van Gool, this map provides a high-level visualization of the development of science during the period 1980–2010. The map is based on all publications in the sciences and the social sciences from this period indexed in the Web of Science bibliographic database. Based on citation patterns, publications were classified into seven broad fields of science—listed color-coded on right.

In the English Wikipedia there is a category called “Living People” which includes articles of people currently alive. To construct the social network of living people, computer scientists Peter A.

Boyack and Richard Klavans create maps of science that are useful for planning and evaluation on national, corporate, and personal levels. Together with Henry G. Small, the creator of the very first map of all of science (<em>1996 Map of Science</em>, featured in the first iteration of this exhibit), Boyack and Klavans have developed a novel approach to identifying emerging topics in science and technology. Two models of science and technology have been created using 20 million Scopus papers and 3 million patents from USPTO published in 1996-2011. These two models—one based on direct citation, and one based on co-citation—are used together to nominate the most emergent clusters of documents at a particular point in time. Each map was created using a multistep process in which 1) papers from Scopus were clustered using citation characteristics, 2) patents were clustered separately using citation characteristics, 3) a map was created using the OpenOrd graph layout routine to combine paper clusters and patent clusters using a cluster-to-cluster BM25 text similarity measure, and (4) a difference function was used to identify which clusters are most emergent based on where papers occur in both maps. A detailed analysis shows that the emerging topics can be classified as either scientific discoveries or technological innovations, and confirms that the identified emerging topics have high face validity.",

    "description": "This map is the culmination of a six-year-long labor of love by noted physicist, visual artist, poet, and peace activist Bernard H. Porter. Porter began compiling the historical data upon which the map is based in 1932 while a fellow in radioactive research at Brown University. He then took most of the summer of 1933, working out of his parent’s home in Houlton, Maine, to compose the map’s striking visuals. The following years were spent circulating the map among prominent physicists and historians of science to verify its accuracy. The end result is a rich geography of a scientific field, one that uses mapping conventions to make understandable the way ideas move and develop over time. Ambitious in scope, the map traces the history of physics from the 6th century B.C. to the present day. Key theoretical starting points such as ‘Mechanics,’ ‘Sound,’ ‘and Light’ appear as water sources from which streams of thought emerge. Located alongside these rivers are “villages” representing figures like Isaac Newton, Alessandro Volta, Werner Heisenberg, and other major contributors to the development of physics. Surrounding it all is the map’s border, which is decorated with 24 diagrams that frequently appear in the work of physicists.",

The work is divided into two distinctive parts. The eastern portion, the “old world,” features software companies, gaming and entertainment companies, and media sites. The western part, the “new world,” is composed of two major continents: the northern one contains social networks, search websites, video websites, blogs, and forums; the southern continent features the major adult-oriented websites, along with sites sharing pirated movies, music, or software. At the very bottom lies the ‘Great Southern Land’ of obsolete websites and online services. Outside the main map are four smaller maps showing U.S. National Security Agency monitoring by country, the most used internet browsers, the most heavily used social networks, and the level of internet penetration by country.

    "description": "Created by digital humanities specialist Elijah Meeks and historian Walter Scheidel, ORBIS is both a schematic network of 3rd century Roman transportation and a website service that allows users to analyze and represent historical transportation. Utilizing a variety of information visualization methods, it provides functionality to find individual routes between the sites in the network as well as calculate and visualize the movement of goods and people in the aggregate by calculating all the routes to or from a selected site. This map shows examples of the various functions available on the ORBIS website used to examine the difference between Rome and London. The maps and diagrams attempt to answer the question of why London did not become one of the capitals of the Roman Empire. Using different data visualization methods, it highlights the connectivity of the Mediterranean and Roman Britain, the seasonal nature of that connectivity, the differences between movement of people compared to the movement of goods, and more general geographic principles such as Tobler’s “shriveling” of space or that the shortest route geographically is very rarely the cheapest or the fastest.

    "description": "Created by digital humanities specialist Elijah Meeks and historian Walter Scheidel, ORBIS is both a schematic network of 3rd century Roman transportation and a website service that allows users to analyze and represent historical transportation. Utilizing a variety of information visualization methods, it provides functionality to find individual routes between the sites in the network as well as calculate and visualize the movement of goods and people in the aggregate by calculating all the routes to or from a selected site. This map shows examples of the various functions available on the ORBIS website used to examine the difference between Rome and London. The maps and diagrams attempt to answer the question of why London did not become one of the capitals of the Roman Empire. Using different data visualization methods, it highlights the connectivity of the Mediterranean and Roman Britain, the seasonal nature of that connectivity, the differences between movement of people compared to the movement of goods, and more general geographic principles such as Tobler’s “shriveling” of space or that the shortest route geographically is very rarely the cheapest or the fastest. To explore ORBIS, go to <a href=\"http://orbis.stanford.edu\" target=\"_blank\">http://orbis.stanford.edu</a>.",

    "description": "Fans of Randall Munroe’s <em>xkcd</em> love the web comic for its combination of dazzling brilliance and laugh-out-loud observations. Underlying the humor, however, is often a message of utmost seriousness. Such is the case with this map, shown here in its entirety in the center and surrounded by zooms of several of the map’s most interesting components. Together, the map shows a meticulously detailed visualization of how economic resources are used and how they get distributed. Drawing information from over 200 separate sources, citations for which are available on the <em>xkcd</em> website, this map uses color-coded boxes to illustrate possession and expenditure, with examples ranging from the the annual cost of fish ownership to the the cost of one B-2 bomber. As is characteristic, the work is laced with humor: for instance, a cluster of blocks denoting the actual cost of one F-22 raptor—a stealth, supersonic fighter aircraft priced at $154 million—is followed by one showing the projected cost of one velociraptor—a stealth, super-deadly dinosaur made popular by Steven Spielberg’s <em>Jurassic Park</em>, priced at $1.9 million. The map also illustrates the dramatic disparity between the world’s rich and poor. Given the growing concern with economic inequality in recent years, this map has the power to serve as a tool for education and action.",

    "description": "Science, technology, and innovation policy researchers Luciano Kay, Alan L. Porter, Ismael Rafols, Nils Newman, and Jan L. Youtie illustrate the particular features of research and development of graphene—a new carbon-based material. The science basemap draws on data from Thomson Reuter's Journal Citation Reports of the Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index of 2009, including 61 million citation links. The patent basemap draws on data from the European Patent Office’s PATSTAT database for 2000-2006, including more than 41 million patent citation links. Both basemaps result from network visualizations of cosine-similarity matrices that reflect publication and patent citation patterns between 222 Web of Science categories and 466 International Patent Classifications (IPCs), respectively. Similar sized categories of mixed hierarchical composition were computed using the mapmaker’s own algorithm. In addition, 18 macro-disciplines—groups of subject categories—and 35 macro-patent categories—technology groups—were identified using factor analysis. The graphene overlays were generated by querying the two datasets using “graphene” and the time period 2000-2013. The resulting maps visually locate bodies of research within the sciences and technology development areas and help illustrate innovation dynamics in support of business and policy decision-making.",

This work, their eighth contribution to the exhibit, shows several relationships between the worlds of altruism and science using maps of the two spaces. The map of altruism was created using text from the websites of 125,000 non-profit organizations (NPOs) in the U.S. using domain names provided by GuideStar USA, Inc. MALLET topic modeling was run on nearly 4 million web pages, and the mission-related topics were located in a two-dimensional space. The map shows the locations of nearly 100,000 NPOs overlaid on this topic space. A map of science was created from 43 million Scopus documents using a two-step process: documents were grouped into 156,000 clusters using a direct citation methodology, and the clusters were mapped using textual similarity. Together, the results demonstrate that, while most NPO efforts support day-to-day activities related to altruistic missions, a surprising amount is used to fund scientific research, particularly in topics related to innovation, environment, and medicine. In contrast, very little NPO effort is used to support research in altruistic missions dealing with different aspects of childhood development. Funding of more research to increase our understanding of these areas could lead to revolutionary advances that parallel those made in technology and medicine in recent years.",

    "description": "The <em>Literary Empires</em> map was created by information scientist John A. Walsh, graduate students Devin Becker, Bradford Demarest, Jonathan Tweedy, Theodora Michaelidou, and graphic designer Laura Pence. It is based on a small sampling of poems by Victorian poets Robert Browning and Algernon Charles Swinburne. As shown in the map, literary works often have an identifiable setting in both time and space. Many Victorians, for instance, were fascinated by classical Greece and medieval Europe, and Victorian writers provide a rich variety of representations of the classical and medieval worlds. Of the total works from any given period, or among a defined set of authors or texts, how many have classical, medieval, biblical, or contemporary settings? The data can answer these questions and trigger other insights into literary history. This map shows the distribution of literary settings across time and space, together with networks of works sharing common settings. Interesting observations may be made. For instance, one finds clusters of poems and gaps in the timeline and concentrations of poems in Italy, Greece, and the Holy Land.

This essential truth becomes readily apparent when viewing <em>Earth</em>, the work of software engineer Cameron Beccario. \n\n<br><br>\n\nUsing data from the Global Forecast System, <em>Earth</em> visualizes worldwide weather patterns using animated wind streams, color coded according to velocity, that sweep across a three-dimensional globe. Truly interactive, the visualization allows the user to spin the globe and zoom in on a desired location. Tapping on that location will then bring up further information about exact coordinates, wind speed, and temperature, with all information updated every three hours. \n\n<br><br>\n\nThe world itself may be seen from different perspectives, as the visualization offers nine different projections, such as conic equidistant, stereographic, or Waterman Butterfly. When Earth was first introduced in December 2013, it only visualized wind patterns. Since then, however, Beccario has increased the number of overlays to include such factors as carbon monoxide concentration, dust and sulfate extinction, along with the measured temperature. Earth also shows the perceived temperature which Beccario calls the Misery Index, borrowing a term from economics.

The figures whose migrations are traced are remarkably varied: from the Greek mathematician Pythagoras to the American Jazz Age entertainer Al Jolson, from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius to the Gothic painter Henry Fuseli, and from the composer Carl Maria von Weber to the father of sexuality studies, Havelock Ellis. \n\n<br><br>\n\nBirthplaces, represented by blue dots, are connected by arcs to places of death, denoted by red dots. The animation reveals how increased concentrations of death places indicate how different cultural centers rise and fall in importance: for instance, how Paris and London supplant the dominance of Rome, how New York pulls Europeans from their places of birth, and how America’s west coast lures Easterners to cross plains and mountains with promises of a new life.

    "description": "This macroscope was created by Kalev H. Leetaru, an expert on big data and global society. It uses as its source material, quite literally, the news of the world. The visualization explores how new stories group countries into distinct clusters, creating an inherent geographic network structure over the planet akin to “communities” as seen through the eyes of the world’s presses. In essence, for every monitored news article published anywhere in the world, it compiles a list of the other countries also mentioned in those articles. \n\n<br><br>\n\nIt is important to note that this is not how often coverage from a country mentions other countries; it is how often coverage from any country in the world that is about that country mentions other countries. In other words, it is about context. \n\n<br><br>\n\nCountries that are frequently mentioned together might reflect geographic proximity, but also economic and political ties, or joint involvement in a major international event. Blue incoming lines indicate countries where at least 10% of the coverage mentioning the source country also mentioned the selected country. Red outgoing lines indicate countries where at least 10% of the coverage mentioning the selected country also mentioned the destination country. \n\n<br><br>\n\nThe size and number of energy pulses moving along the line indicate the percentage of co-occurring mentions. In a given week, nearly every country is mentioned alongside of every other country at least once, so the visualization uses the cutoff of 10% to highlight only the strongest relationships.

    "description": "University of Texas art historian Maximilian Schich and Mauro Martino, head of IBM’s Watson Cognitive Visualization Lab, created Charting Culture, which debuted in August of 2014 and went on to accumulate over 1 million views on YouTube. \n\n<br><br>\n\nIn just five minutes, the animation covers 2,600 years of European and American history, from 600 BCE to 2012 CE, by tracking 120,000 individuals whose birth and death locations were recorded in the knowledge web Freebase. The figures whose migrations are traced are remarkably varied: from the Greek mathematician Pythagoras to the American Jazz Age entertainer Al Jolson, from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius to the Gothic painter Henry Fuseli, and from the composer Carl Maria von Weber to the father of sexuality studies, Havelock Ellis. \n\n<br><br>\n\nBirthplaces, represented by blue dots, are connected by arcs to places of death, denoted by red dots. The animation reveals how increased concentrations of death places indicate how different cultural centers rise and fall in importance: for instance, how Paris and London supplant the dominance of Rome, how New York pulls Europeans from their places of birth, and how America’s west coast lures Easterners to cross plains and mountains with promises of a new life.

Through a multistep process, this galaxy-like map of science was created from citation patterns in 800,000 scientific papers published in 2002. Each dot represents one of 96,000 active research communities. Over time, communities can be born, grow, split, merge, or die. By coupling coefficients between papers, using the VxOrd layout algorithm and a modified single-link clustering routine, Boyack and Klavans were able to calculate the placement of research communities. For example, communities made up solely of papers in biochemistry journals show up in the biochemistry section, while communities that are evenly split between biochemistry and chemistry journals show up midway between biochemistry and chemistry. In 2005, this was the most comprehensive and most accurate literature map ever generated.",

    "description": "Kevin W. Boyack and Richard Klavans create maps of science that can be used for planning and evaluation on the national, corporate, and personal levels. Science itself can be thought of as containing themes and paradigms: themes are current areas of research, while paradigms comprise the dominant tool sets and existing knowledge that are used by current researchers. To visualize these scientific paradigms, Boyack and Klavans used the VxOrd graph layout tool to recursively cluster the 820,000 most important papers referenced in 2003, resulting in 776 paradigms. The most dominant relationships between paradigms were also calculated and are shown as lines between paradigms. The map of scientific paradigms constitutes a reference system that can be used for multiple purposes. Countries, industries, companies, and individual researchers can all locate themselves within the map, either as a single point or as a specific collection of paradigms. Science education and discovery can also be enhanced by linking to the map stories and facts that exemplify content and relationships between scientific paradigms. ",

It is an attempt to realize a prototype of a global simulation that is to be controlled by a community of unlimited participants. [./logicaland] is based on a global world model developed by Frederick Kile and Arnold Rabehl in Wisconsin in the mid-seventies. It has been taken out of its original context and adapted into a participative online game. In rounds of play lasting up to 22 hours, the financial and natural resource endowments of 185 states can be manipulated in an interdependent world system. The simulation starts with “real” values from the year 2001, taken from the statistics contained in the CIA’s <em>World Fact Book</em>. The parameter changes made by participants become “votes” that are polled by the server and fed back into the simulation so that possible effects can be examined. However, a single user’s influence is minimal as it is a fraction of all participants’ actions. Major change requires collective action.

    "description": "Richard Klavans and Kevin W. Boyack share a deep interest in the mapping of science as a valuable tool for planning and evaluation on the national, corporate, and personal levels. The map featured here is based on the largest set of scientific literature mapped by 2007: 7.2 million papers and over 16,000 separate journals, proceedings, and series from a five-year period, 2001-2005. Groups of journals characterizing the disciplines on the map were defined using a metric based on a combination of the bibliographic coupling of references and keyword vectors. A three-dimensional layout of the disciplines (groups of journals) places those disciplines on a sphere, which is then unfolded using a Mercator projection to give a two-dimensional version of the map. A forecast of how the structure of science may change in the near future was generated by evaluating the change in the connectedness of various regions of the map over time. The structure of science is very likely to change in the future, and these maps can show us how. More information can be found at <a href=\"http://mapofscience.com\">http://mapofscience.com</a>.",

    "description": "The <em>Literary Empires</em> map was created by information scientist John A. Walsh, graduate students Devin Becker, Bradford Demarest, Jonathan Tweedy, Theodora Michaelidou, and graphic designer Laura Pence. It is based on a small sampling of poems by Victorian poets Robert Browning and Algernon Charles Swinburne. As shown in the map, literary works often have an identifiable setting in both time and space. Many Victorians, for instance, were fascinated by classical Greece and medieval Europe, and Victorian writers provide a rich variety of representations of the classical and medieval worlds. Of the total works from any given period, or among a defined set of authors or texts, how many have classical, medieval, biblical, or contemporary settings? The data can answer these questions and trigger other insights into literary history. This map shows the distribution of literary settings across time and space, together with networks of works sharing common settings. Interesting observations may be made. For instance, one finds clusters of poems and gaps in the timeline and concentrations of poems in Italy, Greece, and the Holy Land.

    "description": "<p>What does your street smell like? Humans can differentiate thousands of different odors. Yet, city officials and urban planners deal only with the management of a few bad odors. In creating <em>Smelly Maps</em>, University of Turin computer science professor Rossano Schifanella and Bell Labs researchers Luca Maria Aiello and Daniele Quercia teamed up to introduce a new stream of research that celebrates the complex aromas of our cities and makes it possible to use this information in urban design.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>To map urban smellscapes, the project team first created a lexicon of smell-related words. Then, they gathered geotagged social media posts from Flickr, Instagram, and Twitter that included smell-related words. Finally, the smells people posted about were mapped on each street segment. </p><br>\n\n\n\n<p>Click on a street to see how it smells. As you might expect, nature smells are strong near parks and animal smells dominate at the zoo. Where do you find the strongest food smells? </p><br>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about the <em>Smelly Maps</em> project, visit <a href=\"http://goodcitylife.org/smellymaps\" target=\"_blank\">http://goodcitylife.org/smellymaps</a>. </p>",

Created by Lev Manovich, Jeremy Douglass, and Jay Chow of the Software Studies Initiative, <em>Manga Universe</em> shows 1,074,790 unique pages from 883 distinct manga series from Japan, Korea, and China. The series include both very popular long-running titles such as “Naruto” and “One Piece” and also many short-lived titles. The pages are organized according to contrast (horizontal axis) and by the amount of detail and texture (vertical axis). The pages in the bottom part have the least amount of detail, while pages in the top part have the most. The pages with the least contrast are on the left, while pages with the highest contrast are on the right. In between these four extremes, we find every possible stylistic variation. At the same time, we can see which graphical choices are more commonly used by manga artists (the central part of the “cloud” of pages) and which appear much more rarely (bottom and left parts). If you are a beginning manga artist and want to establish a unique style, you may want to position yourself in either of these areas, which so far have not been explored by other artists.

The macroscope makers are convinced of the need to make this kind of analysis of social media available to regular citizens as well as political elites.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>How do you feel about the connection between social networks and electoral processes worldwide? Has real-time analysis of social media ever influenced your political opinion?

    "description": "The <i>Illuminated Diagram of Geographic Map</i> features research and node layout by Kevin W. Boyack and Richard Klavans, data preparation by Chin Hua Kong and Nianli Ma, layout and design created by Michael J. Stamper and Katy Börner, and programming provided by Jagannathan Lakshmipathy and David M. Reagan. The original design, cartography, and programming were created by W. Bradford Paley, John Burgoon, and Peter Kennard. The map uses a combination of high-resolution print and interactive projection to show the many places on Earth where research is performed. The more papers are published, the brighter the illumination of this area. The map uses an Eckert III projection to create a two-dimensional base reference system of the whole world. Overlaid on this map are five million paper records from MEDLINE published between 2000 and 2009, categorized into 554 subdisciplines of science based on the titles of the journals in which they appear. Papers are aggregated into more than 32,000 cities. A city is highlighted if the first author of a paper is in that location. Select any location on the <i>Geographic Map</i> (by brushing your finger over an area on the lectern’s touch screen) and topics studied in that area will be highlighted on the <i>Science Map</i>: the brighter a topic glows, the more papers on that topic originated in the selected area. Conversely, touching a scientific area in the <i>Science Map</i> illuminates places on the <i>Geographic Map</i> where that topic is studied. People and topic buttons support the exploration of publication output by specific individuals and particular lines of research. The keyboard supports retrieval and display of papers based on their Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and MeSH qualifier terms.",

You may not be able to make out the little squares, but they are easy enough to see on the original poster. Each square represents a million people. Looking at the world this way is a revelation. From the perspective of population, China is the biggest country in the world! India is not far behind. For a real shock, compare Indonesia with the United States. Compare Mexico with Canada. Africa is not as big as the news sometimes makes it. Asia has half the people in the world! ",
