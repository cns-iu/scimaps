Komplexe ZusammenhÃ¤nge werden mit klaren und informativen Bildern, Karten, Diagrammen und interaktiven Elementen dargestellt um zu erlÃ¤utern, wo wir heute stehen, wie wir hierher gekommen sind und wie unsere Handlungen die Zukunft des Lebens auf der Erde beeinflussen kÃ¶nnen. Die allererste Ausgabe von EarthPulse zeigt eine Weltkarte des subjektiven Wohlbefindens (SWB). Eine Rangliste der glÃ¼cklichsten Orte der Welt befindet sich auf der rechten Seite. Die Daten bezÃ¼glich des SWB wurden 2006 aus einer Metaanalyse von Nic Marks, Saamah Abdallah, Andrew Simms und Sam Thompson extrahiert (<a href=\"http://happyplanetindex.org\"><u>http://happyplanetindex.org</u></a>). Es ist sofort offensichtlich, dass Armut eine negative Auswirkung auf das Niveau des SWB hat. Die Karte selbst spiegelt andere Indikatoren von Armut und Bruttoinlandsprodukt wider. Adrian White verglich die Daten des SWB mit den Daten von 2005 Ã¼ber den Zugang zu Bildung, die von der Organisation der Vereinten Nationen fÃ¼r Erziehung, Wissenschaft und Kultur (UNESCO) bereitgestellt wurden, mit den Gesundheitsdaten 2005 von den Vereinten Nationen (UNO) und mit den Armutsdaten 2006, die von der CIA heruntergeladen wurden. Es stellte sich heraus, dass das SWB am stÃ¤rksten mit Gesundheit (.7), Wohlstand (.6) und Zugang zu Grundbildung (.6) korreliert. Dies unterstÃ¼tzt den Nachweis, dass, aus einer globalen Perspektive, die grÃ¶ÃŸten Faktoren, die das SWB beeinflussen, die Armut und damit verbundene Variablen sind.

Sometimes the name that a mapmaker gives to a place takes on a life of its own, even when he later has second thoughts and wishes to change it. This is the case with Martin Waldseemüller, who made two world maps in 1507. One map was a small globe shown here, the other is a very large wall map (see 1507 Wall Map.)</p>\n\n<p>Both 1507 Waldseemüller maps are in the James Ford Bell Library Collection.

Sometimes the name that a mapmaker gives to a place takes on a life of its own, even when he later has second thoughts and wishes to change it. This is the case with Martin WaldseemÃ¼ller, who made two world maps in 1507. One map was a small globe shown here, the other is a very large wall map (see 1507 Wall Map.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both 1507 WaldseemÃ¼ller maps are in the James Ford Bell Library Collection. The curators pose this question: \"A name that he added to these maps has appeared on world maps from 1507 to the present. Yet apparently WaldseemÃ¼ller changed his mind about the suitability of the name shortly after he made these first maps. What name is it and why did Martin WaldseemÃ¼ller change his mind?\"</p>",

The Map of Humanity also organizes information, but instead of doing it geographically, the map organizes the locations on the basis of moral, emotional, and cultural significance.\n\nThe continents of this restructuring rest upon the sea of the unconscious, the stormy basis of our thought. The land that emerges from it's broken into three main continents, each related to an aspect of the human mind: superego, ego, and id.\n\nThe superego is dominated by our higher aspirations. It is our moral centre, where our sense of compassion, love, and virtue reside. Hope, family, kindness, and beauty dwell here amongst the peaceful fields and tranquil cities.\n\nThe ego is dominated by reason, rational thought, and order. It is the land of science, where nature is harnessed by the human mind; and order and reason hold sway over emotion and passion.\n\nThe id is the dark continent, dominated by our primitive, animalistic urges. Here hate, greed, avarice, lust, and bigotry run rampant, and war devolves into atrocity. This is the world of our making, carved out of our actions, built upon the collective achievements of the human race.\n\nIt is an attempt to map the last six thousand years of human history and thought upon a theoretical geography to discover a sense of what kind of civilization humanity has attained. And like the geography of human nations, it is in constant flux, changing and growing as long as mankind walks the face of the earth.\n\nThe first version of the map was made as an intaglio print in 1993, but as all the locations had to be written out not only by hand but backwards by hand, the number of locations I could (and was willing to) include was obviously limited. In 2000 I felt I had a computer powerful enough to do a more ambitious, digital version. I pushed it till it reached the limits of what my computer could do, and this accounts for some of the odd errors on the map. That and my own poor spelling.\n\nAdmittedly, the scope of the idea is so vast it is unquestionably impossible to fully realize, but an interesting piece can still result from the effort. It is the journey that counts.\n\nA lot has happened since 2001, and eventually it will have to be updated again. There is lots to fix, lots to add, lots to update.\n\nThe Map of Humanity 3.0 I envision as a collaborative effort. This is my fantasy version, so big in scope as to be just silly. Well. Sillier, at any rate. A vast database of information would be assembled with the help of experts knowledgeable in mythology, literature, urbanology, and, well, everything. It would then be run through a computer program and plotted out. A fractal program could generate the coastlines. Some kind of clustering filter would have to be applied to the locations to get interesting landmasses out of the input. It could be updated every year or two. New land formations, new mountains, rivers, and roads would appear as events unfold, old ones wither away. Cities would change location as what they symbolize changes. I think that would be really neat.\nDescription of Unique Features:\nFrom the mythical cradle of human thought in the Garden of Eden, to the farthest reaches of human imagination, the map plots out mankind’s achievements, trials, and tribulations throughout history. We have constructed a world made up of our own actions and beliefs, as much as the one formed by the land we live on. The map of humanity is formed by our thought, our feelings, our dreams, and our nightmares.\nData Used:\nEverything I could get my hands on. Limited by my ignorance and laziness.\nData Analysis Techniques Applied:\nFlawed but ambitious.",

Sillier, at any rate. A vast database of information would be assembled with the help of experts knowledgeable in mythology, literature, urbanology, and, well, everything. It would then be run through a computer program and plotted out. A fractal program could generate the coastlines. Some kind of clustering filter would have to be applied to the locations to get interesting landmasses out of the input. It could be updated every year or two. New land formations, new mountains, rivers, and roads would appear as events unfold, old ones wither away. Cities would change location as what they symbolize changes. I think that would be really neat.\n\nDescription of Unique Features:\n\nFrom the mythical cradle of human thought in the Garden of Eden, to the farthest reaches of human imagination, the map plots out mankindâ€™s achievements, trials, and tribulations throughout history. We have constructed a world made up of our own actions and beliefs, as much as the one formed by the land we live on. The map of humanity is formed by our thought, our feelings, our dreams, and our nightmares.\n\nData Used:\n\nEverything I could get my hands on. Limited by my ignorance and laziness.\n\nData Analysis Techniques Applied:\n\nFlawed but ambitious.",

    "description_de": "Die Datenabteilung der Weltbank, National Geographic und die Vereinten Nationen haben im Jahre 2005 beschlossen, eine Partnerschaft einzugehen, um ein Bewusstsein fÃ¼r die Millenniums-Entwicklungsziele zu schaffen. Das Ergebnis ist eine groÃŸformatige farbige Wandkarte, welche die Fortschritte hinsichtlich des Erreichens der Ziele hervorhebt und die weit verbreitet wurde. Der National Geographic Ã¼bernahm die Kartografie und das Design nach den Vorgaben der Weltbank. Die Daten stammen aus der Datenbank der <i>World Development Indicators (WDI)</i> der Weltbank und von der Website der Vereinten Nationen. Die Karte, die 2006 erstellt wurde, zeigt Daten bis in das Jahr 2004. Die Weltkarte in der Mitte zeigt die LÃ¤nder nach ihrer Einkommenssituation und bietet damit einen globalen Ãœberblick Ã¼ber die Armut, dem ersten Millenniums-Entwicklungsziel. Alle acht Millenniums-Entwicklungsziele und ihre Auswirkungen auf die Menschheit sind unter der Weltkarte aufgelistet. Die Karte und die Diagramme in der rechten oberen Ecke zeigen, dass schon groÃŸe Fortschritte bei der Verminderung der Armut gemacht worden sind. Die Aussichten, dass das Ziel fÃ¼r 2015 eingehalten wird, sind gut â€“ z.B., dass der Anteil der Menschen, die von weniger als einem US$ pro Tag leben, um die HÃ¤lfte verringert sein wird. Die Millenniums-Entwicklungsziele sind eine internationale Verpflichtung. Sie werden sowohl von den armen als auch von den reichen LÃ¤ndern als ein System zur Messung von Entwicklungsfortschritten anerkannt. Arme LÃ¤nder haben sich dazu verpflichtet, die Armut aktiv zu verringern. Die wohlhabenden LÃ¤nder haben versprochen, die globale wirtschaftliche und soziale Entwicklung zu unterstÃ¼tzen.

Das Archiv des Festivals ermÃ¶glicht es, die Formierung und Kanonisierung der jungen Kunstdisziplin wiederzugeben. Diese Untersuchung des Archivs durch MedienkÃ¼nstler Dietmer Offenhuber, Informationsdesigner Moritz Stefaner, Visualisierungsberaterin Evelyn MÃ¼nster, Softwareentwickler und -forscher Jaume Nualart und Systemanalytiker Gerhard Dirmoser folgt einem Drei-Schritt-Verfahren. Der erste Schritt ist eine quantitative Analyse des gesamten Korpus von 37.432 eingereichten Kunstwerten bei der Prix Ars Electronica. Die Analyse zeigt die Tendenzen der verschiedenen Subgenres der Medienkunst, nationale PrÃ¤ferenzen fÃ¼r bestimmte Genres und die zeitliche Entwicklung der Kategorien. Der zweite Schritt konzentriert sich auf das Bewertungsverfahren des Wettbewerbs: die Rolle der Juroren und ihre sozialen Verbindungen in einer Netzwerkanalyse sowie die Fachbegriffe, die in den geschriebenen Statements der Juroren verwendet werden. Die Karte offenbart eine engmaschige Gemeinschaft und hebt die interdisziplinÃ¤ren Verbindungen hervor, die Ã¼ber das Feld der Medienkunst hinweg bestehen. SchlieÃŸlich untersucht ein kunsthistorisches Zitationsnetz, welche Resonanzen die Siegerprojekte im Kontext der akademischen Literatur und in allgemeinen VerÃ¶ffentlichungen erfahren. Die Visualisierungen offenbaren den Unterschied zwischen dem offiziellen Blick des Festivals und der realen kÃ¼nstlerischen Praxis. ",

Approximately 10 hours of high-fidelity audio and video were recorded on a daily basis from birth to age three. The resulting corpus contains over 100,000 hours of multi-track recordings and constitutes the most comprehensive record of a child’s development made to date. New annotation, analysis, and visualization tools were developed to study and computationally model the early words uttered by the child by tracing back to the contexts in which those words were spoken to him by adults. As shown on the map, the results of this analysis comprise human movement traces, word birthplaces, and social networks. For most children, language development is steady, progressive, and, to a casual observer, effortless. But for some children—those with developmental delays due to biological or environmental causes—language is a major developmental hurdle.

UngefÃ¤hr 10 Stunden Ton- und Videoaufnahmen wurden tÃ¤glich von Geburt an bis zum Alter von drei Jahren aufgezeichnet. Das Ergebnis ist ein Datensatz mit Ã¼ber 100.000 Stunden von Mehrspuraufzeichnungen und stellt die umfassendste Aufzeichnung der Entwicklung eines Kindes dar, die bis heute gemacht worden ist. Neue Kommentar-, Analyse- und Visualisierungswerkzeuge wurden entwickelt, um die ersten WÃ¶rter, die das Kind gesprochen hat, durch ZurÃ¼ckverfolgung zu den Kontexten, in denen die WÃ¶rter zu ihm von Erwachsenen gesprochen wurden, zu studieren und mit einem Computermodell darzustellen. Wie auf der Karte gezeigt wird, umfassen die Analyseergebnisse menschliche Bewegungskurven, â€žGeburtsorteâ€œ von WÃ¶rtern und soziale Netze. FÃ¼r die meisten Kinder ist die Sprachentwicklung ein stetiger, fortschreitender und â€“ fÃ¼r den flÃ¼chtigen Beobachter â€“ mÃ¼heloser Prozess. Aber fÃ¼r manche Kinder â€” solche mit langsamerer Entwicklung auf Grund biologischer oder Umweltursachen â€” stellt die Sprache eine HauptentwicklungshÃ¼rde dar. Die RegelmÃ¤ÃŸigkeiten im hÃ¤uslichen Umfeld zu erkennen, ist notwendig fÃ¼r das VerstÃ¤ndnis der Mechanismen des Spracherwerbs und der Ursachen fÃ¼r langsamere Entwicklung, und eignet sich schlieÃŸlich dazu, Verfahren zur Abhilfe bei SprachentwicklungsstÃ¶rungen zu finden.

Users can enter five types of data: texts, people, projects, events, their relationships, as well as personal comments. The result is a complex social and knowledge network that can be visualized as timelines, co-author maps, or topic landscapes. Shown here are four maps by communication design researcher Marco Quaggiotto of knowledge cartography research: an ‘Author-Topic Map’ that shows the network of key scholars and their research topics (left); a ‘Geographic Map’ that indicates where research on knowledge cartography is performed (upper right); a ‘Timeline’ of authors and publications where authors’ life spans are represented by horizontal lines, while publications and conferences are represented by icons (middle right); and a ‘Thematic Map of Disciplines’ contributing to this research (lower right). Each of the maps presents a partial and specific view of the knowledge space, presenting different aspects of the same reality. The Atlas acts as a container that holds together the wealth of information gathered, selected, filtered, prepared, screened, and symbolized by the system.

Users can enter five types of data: texts, people, projects, events, their relationships, as well as personal comments. The result is a complex social and knowledge network that can be visualized as timelines, co-author maps, or topic landscapes. Shown here are four maps by communication design researcher Marco Quaggiotto of knowledge cartography research: an â€˜Author-Topic Mapâ€™ that shows the network of key scholars and their research topics (left); a â€˜Geographic Mapâ€™ that indicates where research on knowledge cartography is performed (upper right); a â€˜Timelineâ€™ of authors and publications where authorsâ€™ life spans are represented by horizontal lines, while publications and conferences are represented by icons (middle right); and a â€˜Thematic Map of Disciplinesâ€™ contributing to this research (lower right). Each of the maps presents a partial and specific view of the knowledge space, presenting different aspects of the same reality. The Atlas acts as a container that holds together the wealth of information gathered, selected, filtered, prepared, screened, and symbolized by the system.

Wie auf der Karte zu sehen ist, finden literarische Arbeiten oft an erkennbaren zeitlichen und rÃ¤umlichen SchauplÃ¤tzen statt. Viele Menschen in der viktorianischen Zeit waren vom klassischen Griechenland und mittelalterlichen Europa fasziniert. Daher schufen die viktorianischen Dichter eine reiche Auswahl von Werken mit Darstellungen der klassischen und mittelalterlichen Welten. Wie viele der gesamten Arbeiten aus einer bestimmten Periode oder von einer bestimmten Reihe von Autoren oder Texten finden an klassischen, mittelalterlichen, biblischen oder zeitgenÃ¶ssischen SchauplÃ¤tzen statt? Die Daten kÃ¶nnen diese Fragen beantworten und andere Einblicke in die Literarturgeschichte ermÃ¶glichen.

Diese Karte zeigt, was mÃ¶glicherweise ausgelassen wird, wenn nur in einer Datenbank zu einem bestimmten Thema recherchiert wirdâ€”in diesem Fall die EntwicklungsstÃ¶rung Autismus. Es wurden vier bibliografische Datenbanken durchsucht und jede abgerufene VerÃ¶ffentlichung wurde markiert und je nachdem, in welcher Datenbank sie enthalten war, eingefÃ¤rbt. WÃ¤hrend viele VerÃ¶ffentlichungen in mehreren Datenbanken vorhanden waren, enthielt keine einzelne Datenbank die gesamte Literatur zu einem Thema. Jede Datenbank ist einzigartig bezÃ¼glich der enthaltenen Zeitschriften, der abgedeckten Jahre und der VerÃ¶ffentlichungsarten. Die Unterschiede sind ausgeprÃ¤gter bei Datenbanken, die Ã¼ber Zeitschriftenartikel hinausgehen und TagungsbÃ¤nde, Dissertationen und BÃ¼cher einschlieÃŸen. Selbst wenn die Datenbanken Ã¼ber den gleichen Inhalt verfÃ¼gen, funktionieren die Suchwerkzeuge jeder Datenbank anders.

Die Rangfolge der Beziehungen entspricht ihrer zeitlichen Dauer in Jahren. Das Ende des Diagramms, das Zeitspannen von 30 und mehr Jahren darstellt, steht fÃ¼r fast lebenslange Beziehungen. Dumenton hat ebenfalls die Motivationen und Interessen, die hinter wissenschaftlichen Beziehungen stehen, erfasst und eine Typologie erkenntnistheoretischer Aspekte von wissenschaftlichen Kooperationen entwickelt. Abbildung 6 listet Kategorien zur Bewertung wissenschaftlicher Kooperation auf: z.B. Bewertung der Ideen und Ergebnisse des Forschers, ihre/seine Methoden, sowie der Zustand und Austausch von GerÃ¤ten und anderer Forschungsinstrumente/-technik.

Viele UniversitÃ¤ten haben Personal abgebaut, GehÃ¤lter bis zu 20 % gekÃ¼rzt oder einen Einstellungstopp ausgerufen. Studenten, die in diesem Jahr ihr Studium beenden oder Post-Doktoranden, die mit ihrer Karriere weiterkommen wollen, stehen in einem starken Wettbewerb um die wenigen ArbeitsplÃ¤tze.

    "description": "Information scientists and colleagues at the Complex Systems Institute of Paris Ile-de-France David Chavalarias and Jean-Philippe Cointet have developed a method to automatically reconstruct representations of science evolution from the large-scale analysis of digital repositories: <em>phylomemies</em>. Analogous to phylogenies in biology, a phylomemy describes the transformations of scientific fields over time: from most simple events like field emergence or decline, to more complex transformation like field merging or splitting. This map presents, for the first time, a still partial representation of a phylomemy, related to Future and Emerging Technologies, built from the analysis of tens of millions of scientific paper metadata. The detailed phylomemetic branch presented on this map shows how the field of prosthetic science, after some experiments with implantable devices (neuroprosthesis), was revolutionized by its merge with the field of brain machine interfaces, which first arose a few years earlier. Phylomemies can also be used as high-level descriptions of science evolution that, once interfaced with digital libraries, offer new ways to browse large datasets of documents.

Sinnott und The Interactive Factory fÃ¼r <i>Sky & Teleskope</i> entworfen wurde, kann Ansichten des mit bloÃŸem Auge zu sehenden Himmels fÃ¼r jeden Ort der Erde, zu jedem Zeitpunkt der Nacht und an irgendeinem Datum von 1600 bis 2400 simulieren. Der Kreis, der hier zu sehen ist, simuliert den Blick in die Himmelskuppel Ã¼ber New York City im April 2006. Das gelbe Rechteck stellt den Blick dar, wenn man in den sÃ¼dÃ¶stlichen Teil der Kuppel schaut. Das violette Rechteck ist ein Blick in die Tiefen des Alls. Die gezeigten Sterne und Planeten sind diejenigen, die ohne optische Hilfsmittel unter klarem Vorstadthimmel normalerweise sichtbar sind. Objekte im fernen Weltall, die mit einem Fernglas gesehen werden kÃ¶nnen, sind ebenfalls dargestellt. Beobachtungen aus vielen Jahrhunderten werden verwendet, um vorauszusagen, welche Sterne und Planeten von den unterschiedlichen Regionen aus zu den verschiedenen Zeiten des Jahres sichtbar sind. Um einen Punkt auf der Erde oder der Himmelskugel festzulegen, verwenden GeodÃ¤ten kugelfÃ¶rmige Koordinaten. Wenn es sich um die Erde handelt, werden sie Breiten- und LÃ¤ngengrade genannt. Die Astronomen erweitern die Koordinaten der Erde in die Himmelskugel hinaus und nennen sie Deklination und Rektaszension, die im Bezug auf die Position der Sterne feststehend bleiben. Daher kÃ¶nnen sie auf Sternenkarten dauerhaft aufgedruckt werden.

    "description_de": "Nur wenige BÃ¼cher sind so grÃ¼ndlich analysiert worden wie die Bibel. Seit Jahrtausenden haben Gelehrte aus vielen Religionen den Text genau studiert, und seine Bedeutung und Anleitung extrahiert. AnknÃ¼pfend an diese lange Tradition haben Chris Harrison, ein Doktorand am Human-Computer Interaction Institute der Carnegie Mellon University, und Christoph RÃ¶mhild, ein lutherischer Pfarrer, gemeinsam ein mehrfarbiges Bogendiagramm der Querverweise in der Lutherbibel hergestellt. In dieser Visualisierung werden Informationen, die auf Tausenden von Textseiten zu finden sind, zu einem einzigen visuellen Ãœberblick zusammengefasst. Das Balkendiagramm, das an der Unterseite entlang verlÃ¤uft, reprÃ¤sentiert alle Kapitel der Bibel. Die Kapitel sind abwechselnd in weiÃŸer und leicht grauer Farbe dargestellt. Die LÃ¤nge jedes Balkens kennzeichnet die Anzahl von Bibelversen in jedem Kapitel. Jeder einzelne der 63.779 Querverweise, die in der Bibel zu finden sind, wird durch einen einzelnen Bogen dargestellt, dessen Farbe der Entfernung zwischen den beiden Kapiteln entspricht, wodurch eine regenbogenfarbige Wirkung erzielt wird. Weitere Informationen finden Sie auf: <a href=\"http://chrisharrison.net/projects/bibleviz\"><u>http://chrisharrison.net/projects/bibleviz</u></a>. ",

    "description_de": "Paul Marie Ghislain Otlet (1868-1944), ein belgischer Rechtsanwalt und Internationalist, hat sein ganzes Leben lang an der Institutionalisierung der Wissensproduktion und -verbreitung gearbeitet. Im Jahre 1895 haben er und Henri La Fontaine das Internationale Institut fÃ¼r Bibliografie in BrÃ¼ssel gegrÃ¼ndet, um die Ausarbeitung eines universalen bibliografischen Katalogs und verwandter Sammlungen von Abbildungen und Dokumentationsdateien zu unterstÃ¼tzen. In 1910 haben sie die Sammlungen im Palais Mondial in BrÃ¼ssel mit der Idee zusammengefÃ¼hrt, es zu einer globalen Wissensinstitution einschlieÃŸlich eines Weltmuseums, einer Weltbibliothek, einer WeltuniversitÃ¤t usw. zu entwickeln: Das Mundaneum. Otlet hat sich Mundaneen in verschiedenen StÃ¤dten der ganzen Welt vorgestellt sowie ein groÃŸes Netzwerk von lokalen, regionalen und nationalen Zentren der Wissensproduktion: Species Mundaneum. Die hier gezeigte <i>MondothÃ¨que</i> war eine Verbindung  in diesem hierarchischen Netzwerk. Otlet hat die <i>MondothÃ¨que</i> als einen Arbeitsplatz entworfen, der zu Hause benutzt werden kann, damit die Menschen Wissen produzieren und verbreiten kÃ¶nnen. Er enthielt Referenzarbeiten, Kataloge, Multimedia-Ersatz fÃ¼r traditionelle BÃ¼cher wie zum Beispiel Mikrofilme, Fernsehen, Radio und schlieÃŸlich eine neue Form der EnzyklopÃ¤die, die Enzyklopedia Universalis Mundaneum, die aus reproduzierbaren â€žAtlantenâ€œ einschlieÃŸlich Diagrammen, Postern und anderen illustrierenden Materialien bestand. Unter der MondothÃ¨que kann man sich eine analoge VerkÃ¶rperung der heute allgegenwÃ¤rtigen computerbasierten digitalen FunktionalitÃ¤ten vorstellen. ",

Die Kurve auf der linken Seite zeigt die Anzahl der Wissenschaftler und das BevÃ¶lkerungswachstum in den USA fÃ¼r fast 30 Jahre: 1940-1969. Martino hat errechnet, dass das VerhÃ¤ltnis von Wissenschaftlern an der BevÃ¶lkerung sich von unter 0,5 % auf ungefÃ¤hr 1 % erhÃ¶ht hatte. Heute haben die USA ungefÃ¤hr 300 Millionen Einwohner und davon sind ungefÃ¤hr 5 Millionen (1,7%) Wissenschaftler. Auf der rechten Seite wird das Wachstum des US-Bruttosozialprodukts (Gross National Product â€“ GNP) seit 1946 und die DollarbetrÃ¤ge, die fÃ¼r Forschung und Entwicklung (Research and Development â€“ R&D) in den Jahren 1953-1968 aufgewendet wurden, gezeigt. Der Anteil des US-Bruttosozialprodukts (BSP), der fÃ¼r Forschung und Entwicklung (FuE) aufgewendet wurde, hat sich in jenem Zeitraum von etwas weniger als 1,5 % auf 3 % verdoppelt. Im Jahre 2008 betrug das BSP der USA 13 Billionen $, wobei ungefÃ¤hr 0,3 Billionen $ (2.3%) fÃ¼r FuE ausgegeben wurden. WÃ¤hrend der Prozentanteil von Wissenschaftlern an der GesamtbevÃ¶lkerung stetig zugenommen hat, scheint der Anteil des BSP fÃ¼r FuE-Investitionen konstant geblieben zu sein und nimmt in seiner Kaufkraft ab. Der Hauptzweck dieser Karte ist zu zeigen, dass sich die Wissenschaft zu einem Gleichgewicht hinbewegt und dass die wissenschaftspolitischen EntscheidungstrÃ¤ger anfangen mÃ¼ssen, darÃ¼ber nachzudenken, wie die Schocks eines solchen Ãœberganges abgefedert werden kÃ¶nnen.",

    "description": "Kevin W. Boyack and Richard Klavans are interested in creating high-quality maps of science that can be used as tools for planning and evaluation on multiple levels. In this work, Boyack and Klavans simplify their <em>Maps of Science: Forecasting Large Trends in Science</em> (featured in the third iteration of this exhibit) into a circular map. The 554 scientific disciplines, representing over 16,000 journals and proceedings, are placed in a logical order around the perimeter of a circle. The resulting “circle of science” is used as a reference system to show the scientific roots of technology. Over 18,000 inventor-authors from the Scopus publication and <em>United States Patent and Trademark Office</em> databases (2002-2006) were identified to link technological output (patents) from inventors to scientific output (papers) of authors. Authors are located within the circle map at the average position of their scientific papers using the disciplines in which they publish. Patents by these authors are then placed at the authors’ locations on the map. Some patents and classes are tied to one area of science (e.g., ‘G06F,’ near the edge), while others build on multiple areas of science (e.g., ‘C07D,’ near the center). Some areas of science (e.g., physics, computer science) are tied to large numbers of patents, while other areas of science (e.g., social sciences) are tied to very few patents. ",

    "description_en": "Kevin W. Boyack and Richard Klavans are interested in creating high-quality maps of science that can be used as tools for planning and evaluation on multiple levels. In this work, Boyack and Klavans simplify their <em>Maps of Science: Forecasting Large Trends in Science</em> (featured in the third iteration of this exhibit) into a circular map. The 554 scientific disciplines, representing over 16,000 journals and proceedings, are placed in a logical order around the perimeter of a circle. The resulting â€œcircle of scienceâ€ is used as a reference system to show the scientific roots of technology. Over 18,000 inventor-authors from the Scopus publication and <em>United States Patent and Trademark Office</em> databases (2002-2006) were identified to link technological output (patents) from inventors to scientific output (papers) of authors. Authors are located within the circle map at the average position of their scientific papers using the disciplines in which they publish. Patents by these authors are then placed at the authorsâ€™ locations on the map. Some patents and classes are tied to one area of science (e.g., â€˜G06F,â€™ near the edge), while others build on multiple areas of science (e.g., â€˜C07D,â€™ near the center). Some areas of science (e.g., physics, computer science) are tied to large numbers of patents, while other areas of science (e.g., social sciences) are tied to very few patents. ",

Jedes Jahr wird der meteorfÃ¶rmigen Manifestation des Wissens eine weitere Schicht hinzugefÃ¼gt. Neue Teilgebiete entstehen (blau), und bestehende Teilgebiete (braun) vermischen sich, spalten sich auf oder verschwinden.

Andere Gebiete kommunizieren Wissen mittels BÃ¼chern, und es kÃ¶nnen Jahre vergehen, bevor die erste ZitationsbrÃ¼cke entsteht.

The Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS) is both a major shipping route and an area heavily used by endangered whales.

To reduce collision risk, the team of research coordinator David N. Wiley, spatial analyst Michael A.

As compared to the original TSS, whale sightings in the reconfigured TSS were reduced by 81% and right whale sightings by 58%. Industry transit times increased 9–22 minutes. The TSS shift was accepted by the United Nations’ International Maritime Organization in December of 2006 and became active in July of 2007.

Das Naturschutzgebiet Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS) ist sowohl eine Hauptschiffsverkehrsroute als auch ein Gebiet, in dem viele vom Aussterben bedrohte Wale leben. Da die Routen des Bostoner Verkehrstrennungsgebiets das Naturschutzgebiet kreuzen, ist das Gebiet ein potenzieller â€žKrisenherdâ€œ fÃ¼r Kollisionen von Walen und Schiffen. Um das Kollisionsrisiko zu verringern, hat das Team bestehend aus dem Forschungskoordinator David N. Wiley, dem Raumanalytiker Michael A. Thompson und dem Meeresforscher Richard Merrick die folgenden Schritte unternommen: (1) Aufzeichnung der Verbreitung und der relativen HÃ¤ufigkeit von Sichtungen des Nordatlantik-Glattwales und anderer Bartenwale innerhalb des Naturschutzgebietes und der angrenzenden GewÃ¤sser, (2) Identifikation der am meisten von Walen genutzten Gebiete, (3) Neugestaltung des derzeitigen Verkehrstrennungsgebiets durch das Naturschutzgebiet fÃ¼r die rÃ¤umliche Trennung von Walen und Schiffen und (4) Berechnung der mÃ¶glichen Risikovermeidung. Im Vergleich zum ursprÃ¼nglichen Verkehrstrennungsgebiet haben sich die Sichtungen aller Wale im neu gestalteten Verkehrstrennungsgebiet um 81 % und die Sichtungen von Glattwalen um 58% verrringert. Die Transitverkehrszeiten erhÃ¶hten sich um 9-22 Minuten. Die Neugestaltung des Verkehrstrennungsgebietes wurde von der Internationalen Seeschifffahrtsorganisation der Vereinten Nationen im Dezember von 2006 akzeptiert und wird seit Juli 2007 angewandt.

Altogether, he generated over 50 maps looking among others at differential price rates for the transport of goods and people. This is the seventh and final version in a series of maps showing the impact of the American Civil War (1861–1865) on the European cotton trade. The flows of raw cotton prior, during, and after the war are depicted as colored bands. The width of the bands represents the amount of raw cotton imported, with one millimeter representing 5000 barrels. Prior to the U.S. Civil War, most of Europe relied exclusively on the U.S. South as the sole source of this indispensable raw material (blue band). Export blockades during the war changed global trade patterns, instigating a fierce competition between the U.S. (blue band), India and China (orange band), and Egypt (brown band). Minard argued that “a sustained competition among the rival producers would be most useful for England and Europe.” In the mid-to-late 1800s, his influence and contribution to visually based planning was so influential that all Ministers of Public Works in France had their portraits painted with one of Minard’s maps in the background. One of Minard’s most famous maps, <em>Napoleon’s March to Moscow</em>, is shown in the first iteration of this exhibit. ",

    "description_de": "Charles Joseph Minard war ein franzÃ¶sischer Bauingenieur und ein echter Pionier in thematischer Kartografie und statistischen Grafiken. Insgesamt erstellte er Ã¼ber 50 Karten, welche die Kosten fÃ¼r den Transport von Waren und Personen zeigen. Dies ist die siebente und abschlieÃŸende Version einer Reihe von Karten, die die Auswirkung des amerikanischen BÃ¼rgerkrieges (1861-1865) auf den europÃ¤ischen Baumwollhandel zeigen. Die WarenflÃ¼sse von Rohbaumwolle vor, wÃ¤hrend und nach dem Krieg werden als farbige Streifen bildlich dargestellt. Die Breite der Streifen stellt die Menge der importierten Rohbaumwolle dar, wobei ein Millimeter 5000 FÃ¤ssern entspricht. Vor dem amerikanischen BÃ¼rgerkrieg war der grÃ¶ÃŸte Teil Europas ausschlieÃŸlich auf den SÃ¼den der USA als alleinige Quelle dieses unentbehrlichen Rohstoffes angewiesen (blauer Streifen). Exportblockaden wÃ¤hrend des Krieges Ã¤nderten die globalen Handelsmuster, und ein starker Wettbewerb zwischen den USA (blauer Streifen), Indien und China (oranger Streifen) und Ã„gypten (brauner Streifen) kam auf. Minard argumentierte, dass â€žein fortwÃ¤hrender Wettbewerb zwischen den rivalisierenden Produzenten fÃ¼r England und Europa am nÃ¼tzlichsten wÃ¤re.â€œ In der zweiten HÃ¤lfte des 19. Jahrhunderts waren sein Einfluss auf und sein Beitrag zur Planung auf der Grundlage bildlicher Darstellungen so groÃŸ, dass sich alle Transportminister Frankreichs vor einer von Minards Karten protrÃ¤tieren lieÃŸen. Eine von Minards berÃ¼hmtesten Karten, <i>Napoleons Russlandfeldzug</i>, ist in der ersten Folge dieser Ausstellung zu sehen. ",

    "description_de": "Die Verbindung von alten und neuen Techniken steht im Zentrum des Buches <i>Cartographica Extraordinaire: The Historical Map Transformed</i> von David Rumsey und Edith M. Punt, dessen Einband hier gezeigt wird. Die Karten, die in diesem Buch herausgebracht werden, erzÃ¤hlen einhundert individuelle, aufregende, wichtige und manchmal umstrittene Geschichten. Die Geschichten folgen zwei Hauptpfaden von Nachforschungen: Wie wurde aus einer kontinentalen Wildnis eine Zivilisation, und wie hat die Entwicklung der kartografischen Wissenschaft die Art und Weise, wie wir dieses Land wahrnehmen, beschreiben, studieren und nutzen, verÃ¤ndert? <i>Cartographica Extraordinaire</i> zeigt phantastische Reproduktionen aus der berÃ¼hmten Kartensammlung von David Rumsey â€“ einer der grÃ¶ÃŸten und vollstÃ¤ndigsten ihrer Art. Die Sammlung besteht aus mehr als 150.000 EinzelstÃ¼cken: Karten, Atlanten und kontextbezogene Belegdokumente, und konzentriert sich zum grÃ¶ÃŸten Teil auf Nord- und SÃ¼damerika im 18. und 19. Jahrhundert. Anders als bei Ã¤hnlichen Sammlungen sind die Karten, deren Empfindlichkeit und Seltenheit eine sorgfÃ¤ltige Lagerung und eingeschrÃ¤nkte Verwendungsrichtlinien notwendig machen, im Internet auf <a href=\"http://davidrumsey.com\">http://davidrumsey.com</a>.",

BibSonomy lets users retrieve, tag, and share publication references encoded in BibTex as well as  Web links.</p>\n\n<p>This poster provides an overview of sharing and tagging behavior in BibSonomy. A total of 268,584 publication references and 60,876 Web links compiled on Sept 29th, 2008 was analyzed. The pie chart on the top left shows the different entity types within the BibTex encoded publication data. About 50% of the total publication records are articles. Below are top-20 counts for journals, author institutions, publishers, and books.</p>\n\n<p>The figure in the center shows the distribution of BibTex article data across the different sciences. The visualization uses the ‘UCSD Basemap of Science’ created by Boyack and Klavans (2007).</p>\n\n<p>The UCSD basemap is based on 7.2 million papers and over 16,000 separate journals, proceedings, and series from Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science and Elsevier’s Scopus database over a five year period, 2001-2005.</p>\n\n<p>Bibliographic coupling using highly cited references and keywords was applied to determine the similarity of journals. The final layout step was done using the 3D Fruchterman-Rheingold algorithm in Pajek; the results were so close to spherical (i.e., no nodes were in the middle) that all nodes were given a unit distance from the ‘center of mass’, resulting in a spherical layout. To ease navigation and exploration, a Mercator projection was applied to convert the spherical layout into the 2-dimensional map. Dots represent groups of topically similar journals. Links denote strong bibliographic coupling relations. Major areas of science are color coded and labeled. As every node on the map represents a set of journals, scholarly entities can be overlaid based on matching of journal names.\nEighty percent of the articles in over 3,000 journals can be located on the map. Most of the papers are in the social sciences and there is a strong focus on brain research, math, physics, electrical engineering, and computer science. Node size represents the number of papers  per node.</p>\n\n<p>On the right hand side are distributions in the data for records (meaning BibTeX entries and bookmarks), tags, articles, and users. The distribution of records by the number of tags they have is exponential, the distribution of articles by the number of authors they have is linear, and the distribution of users by the number of records they upload is exponential near the low end with a fuzzy power law tail. Each distribution is given with frequencies (blue diamonds) and ranks (pink squares). Exactly 24,831 records (only BibTeX entries; every bookmark has at least one tag) have zero tags while 230,363 have 1 and 75,421 have 2. The highest number of tags is 101.</p>\n\n<p>Most articles have 1-10 authors.

    "description": "As part of USAID's Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT) program, the PREDICT project focuses on increasing capacity in the developing world for early detection of viruses from wildlife with pandemic potential. The project’s focus is important, as over 70% of emerging zoonotic diseases have come from wildlife over the past 40 years (e.g., SARS, avian influenza, HIV). Created by prominent members in the fields of epidemiology, pediatrics, virology, and conservation medicine, the public-facing PREDICT HealthMap website provides a dynamic visual display of the results of PREDICT surveillance for potential pandemic viruses in wildlife.  \n\nShown here on the right is a sample of the search criteria that can be used and a  listing of disease cases for May 2014. Below the global map at center-left are three zooms highlighting HealthMap Alerts for PREDICT regions. HealthMap Alerts are formal and informal reports of disease outbreaks, collected by HealthMap's automated process. Updated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days each year, the system monitors, organizes, integrates, filters, visualizes, and disseminates information about priority diseases. The interactive PREDICT HealthMap is freely available online, delivering real-time intelligence on a broad range of emerging infectious diseases for a diverse audience including local health departments, governments, and international agencies concerned with disease outbreaks at <a href=\"http://healthmap.org/predict\" target=\"_blank\">http://healthmap.org/predict</a>.",

    "description_de": "Diese Karte wurde von dem Forschungsprogrammierer Bruce W. Herr II, dem Biomedizin-Forscher Gully A.P.C. Burns, dem Informatiker David Newman und dem Programmdirektor der National Institutes of Health (NIH) Edmund Talley entwickelt. Es ist eine Ã¤hnlichkeitsbasierte thematische Karte aller Forschungsprojekte, die von den NIH im Jahr 2007 gefÃ¶rdert wurden. Jedes der ungefÃ¤hr 60.000 Projekte wird als ein Punkt dargestellt, der je nach NIH-Institut farblich gekennzeichnet worden ist. Um die Karte zu erstellen, wurde das Thema jedes FÃ¶rderprojektes mithilfe von Topic Modeling, eine unÃ¼berwachte Methode des maschinellen Lernens auf der statistischen Grundlage von gleichzeitig vorkommenden WÃ¶rtern in den Abstracts der Projekte, untersucht. Die FÃ¶rderprojekte wurden auf der Karte mithilfe eines Layout-Algorithmus platziert, der die Projekte mit Ã¤hnlichen Themen in Cluster gruppiert.

    "description_de": "R. Buckminster Fuller, der berÃ¼hmte VisionÃ¤r und Futurist, war einer der Ersten, die langfristige Tendenzen der Industrialisierung und Globalisierung schon in den dreiÃŸiger Jahren kartierten. 1961 machte Fuller der Internationalen Vereinigung der Architekten auf ihrem 7. Kongress den Vorschlag, die Architekturschulen der ganzen Welt dazu zu ermutigen, die folgenden 10 Jahre fÃ¼r folgendes Thema zu verwenden: Wie kann man die gesamten Ressourcen der Welt, die damals nur von 40% der WeltbevÃ¶lkerung genutzt wurden, der gesamten Menschheit zu Nutze machen? Dies war der Beginn der World Design Science Decade (WDSD), einem internationalen Programm zur Anwendung seiner Strategien fÃ¼r Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science â€” einer umfassenden und vorrausschauenden Designwissenschaft. Das Programm selbst hat nie begonnen, jedoch offenbaren die Dokumente an sich das frÃ¼he Ã¶kologische Denken im 20. Jahrhundert. Diese Tendenzkarte, erstellt aus Dokument 6 von Fuller und seinem Mitarbeiter John McHale, zeigt, wie das Zusammenwirken der Kommunikations- und Transporttechnologien eine â€žschrumpfende Erdeâ€œ hervorbringt. WÃ¤hrend des gleichen Jahrzehnts sagte Gordon E. Moore die Beschleunigungskurve bei Computertechnologien (Mooresches Gesetz) voraus. Fuller verwendete seinen komplexen Ansatz, um die globale Auswirkung dessen, was er â€žbeschleunigte Beschleunigungâ€œ und â€žEphemerisierungâ€œ (Tendenz zu immer kleineren, leichteren und effizienteren Technologien) nannte, zu kartieren.

    "description_de": "Der Council for Chemical Research (CCR) hat Experten fÃ¼r Wirtschaftswissenschaften beauftragt, eine Zweiphasenstudie Ã¼ber den quantitativen Einfluss von Forschung und Entwicklung (FuE) in den chemischen Wissenschaften durchzufÃ¼hren. Die Studie wurde 2005 unter dem Titel <i>Measure for Measure: Chemical R&D Powers the U.S. Innovation Engine</i> herausgegeben. Mithilfe von Patent- und wissenschaftlicher Literatur wurde ein 20jÃ¤hriger Zeitstrahl von der Grundlagenforschung bis zur MarkteinfÃ¼hrung festgelegt. Ferner haben die Experten die zwei wichtigsten Feedback-Zyklen identifiziert: (1) die Innovationen in der chemischen Industrie sind direkt mit der Grundlagenforschung, die mit staatlichen Mitteln gefÃ¶rdert wird, verbunden, und (2) die 1 Milliarde $ an staatlichen Investitionen wird durch ca. 5 Milliarden $ Industrieinvestitionen fÃ¼r Erfindungsentwicklung und Technologiekommerzialisierung erhÃ¶ht. Die Experten haben ebenfalls errechnet, dass jeder Dollar, der von der Chemieindustrie in FuE investiert worden ist, Ã¼ber die vergangenen zwanzig Jahre hinweg zwei Dollar an erhÃ¶htem Betriebseinkommen erzeugt hat â€“ eine 17 %ige Investitionsrendite nach Steuern. Im Jahr 2005 haben Forscher des Los Alamos National Laboratory die makroÃ¶konomischen Auswirkungen der Einnahmen der Chemieindustrie in HÃ¶he von 10 Milliarden $ auf das Bruttosozialprodukt (BSP) und die ArbeitsplÃ¤tze untersucht. Unter Verwendung des REMI Policy Insight-Modells haben sie einen BSP Multiplikator von 4 ermittelt, der, wenn er auf das Betriebseinkommen der Branche von 10 Milliarden $ angewandt wird, 40 Milliarden $ an BSP ergibt. Dadurch werden auch 600.000 neue ArbeitsplÃ¤tze geschaffen und ungefÃ¤hr 8 Milliarden $ an zusÃ¤tzlichen Steuereinnahmen jÃ¤hrlich erzielt, von denen wiederum etwas in die chemische FuE investiert wird, womit sich der Kreis schlieÃŸt.

Boyack and Richard Klavans, data preparation by Chin Hua Kong and Nianli Ma, layout and design created by Michael J. Stamper and Katy Börner, and programming provided by Jagannathan Lakshmipathy and David M. Reagan. The original design and programming were created by W. Bradford Paley and Peter Kennard. As the map illustrates, the word “science” covers a huge diversity of topics: from mathematics and astronomy to medicine, and even to certain approaches to the humanities. This map begins to show how distinct areas of study are defined and related, and what research is performed in which areas. The science base map was created using more than 7.5 million papers published in 16,000 separate journals between 2001 and 2005 in Thomson Reuters’ <i>Web of Science</i> and Elsevier’s <i>Scopus</i> databases.

As the map illustrates, the word â€œscienceâ€ covers a huge diversity of topics: from mathematics and astronomy to medicine, and even to certain approaches to the humanities. This map begins to show how distinct areas of study are defined and related, and what research is performed in which areas.

In dieser Karte fÃ¼hren Boyack und Klavans eine Methode zur Identifizierung und Visualisierung von FÃ¼hrerschaft in der Forschung ein, bei der sie ein Klassifizierungssystem verwenden, in dem Millionen von Forschungsarbeiten in Ã¼ber 80.000 Cluster eingeteilt werden. Diese 80.000 Bausteine werden fÃ¼r jede Nation individuell wieder zusammengesetzt, so dass sich die Forschungsgebiete, in denen diese LÃ¤nder fÃ¼hrend sind, offenbaren. Die Analyse der 13 fÃ¼hrenden Nationen hinsichtlich von VerÃ¶ffentlichungen zeigt, dass diese neue Methode zur Messung der FÃ¼hrerschaft in der Forschung eine viel genauere und detailliertere Darstellung der eigentlichen wissenschaftlichen StÃ¤rke von Nationen ermÃ¶glicht, als es die auf Zeitschriften basierende Methode vermag. Vor allem werden durch die Verwendung dieser neuen Methode die StÃ¤rken kleinerer Nationen, einschlieÃŸlich ihrer StÃ¤rken in Teildisziplinen und im interdisziplinÃ¤ren Bereich, genauer identifiziert. Wenn man die StÃ¤rken der USA mit denen der 12 fÃ¼hrenden konkurrierenden Nationen Ã¼bereinander gelagert zeigt, werden die Bereiche sichtbar, in denen diese Nationen eine FÃ¼hrungsrolle haben, an die die USA nicht heranreicht.

Anders als bei den meisten Kunstwerken stellen seine Karten nichts Hypothetisches oder Erfundenes bildlich dar, sondern basieren auf Fakten aus Mainstream-Publikationen wie der <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Washington Post</i> oder der <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. Lombardi organisierte diese Fakten sorgfÃ¤ltig in einer handgeschriebenen Datenbank von Ã¼ber 14.000 Karteikarten mit Querverweisen. Er stellte regelmÃ¤ÃŸig seine â€žerzÃ¤hlenden Strukturenâ€œ mit den Materialien seiner Wahl her: farbigem Bleistift und Graphit auf Papier. Diese Karte zeigt die fÃ¼nfte Version einer Karte, die sich auf die ZusammenhÃ¤nge von illegalem Waffenhandel von chinesischen Nationalisten in Los Angeles mit mÃ¶glicher Korruption bei der Wahlkampffinanzierung durch das WeiÃŸe Haus konzentrieren. Es werden zwei Ebenen von Informationen dargestellt: wesentliche Grundelemente der Geschichte in schwarz und wichtige Prozesse, Strafverfahren und andere gerichtliche Schritte gegen die Beteiligten in rot. Verbindungen der unterschiedlichsten Art offenbaren sich: ein ununterbrochener Pfeil stellt Einfluss oder Kontrolle dar, ein doppelter Pfeil eine gegenseitige Beziehung oder Verbindung, ein gestrichelter Pfeil den Geldfluss, Darlehen oder Kredite, eine Zick-Zack-Linie den Verkauf oder die Ãœbertragung eines Wertes und ein doppelter Trennstrich eine blockierte oder unvollendete Transaktion.

This visualization depicts the classification taxonomy developed and used in the MACE project (<a href=\"http://portal.mace-project.eu\"><u>http://portal.mace-project.eu</u></a>), which aims at providing better access to digital resources for teaching and learning about architecture. It shows a bird’s-eye view of the hierarchical structure of over 2,800 terms for tagging resources. Most of the terms exist in English, Spanish, German, Italian, and Dutch.

Tausende Seiten von Rohdaten sind hier zu einer offenen und zugÃ¤nglichen Aufzeichnung der Landesausgaben umgewandelt worden. Es ist eine einzigartig aufschlussreiche Darstellung nationaler PrioritÃ¤ten, die jÃ¤hrlich gemÃ¤ÃŸ den WÃ¼nschen des PrÃ¤sidenten, der Macht des Kongresses, und dem Willen der Menschen fluktuieren. Ãœber 500 Programme und Abteilungen und fast jedes Programm, das pro Jahr Ã¼ber 200 Millionen $ empfÃ¤ngt, werden hier mithilfe einer hierarchischen Baumstruktur gezeigt. Die GrÃ¶ÃŸe jedes Knotens entspricht der Menge der finanziellen Mittel, die das jeweilige Programm erhÃ¤lt.

Um diese wissenschaftlichen Paradigmen zu veranschaulichen, haben Boyack und Klavans das VxOrd Tool verwendet, um die 820.000 wichtigsten Arbeiten, die 2003 zitiert wurden, rekursiv einzugruppieren. Das Ergebnis sind 776 Paradigmen. Die bedeutsamsten Beziehungen zwischen Paradigmen wurden ebenfalls errechnet und als Linien zwischen den Paradigmen gezeigt. Die Karte der wissenschaftlichen Paradigmen erschafft ein Referenzsystem, das fÃ¼r mehrere Zwecke verwendet werden kann. LÃ¤nder, Branchen, Unternehmen und einzelne Forscher kÃ¶nnen sich alle darin wiederfinden â€“ in einem oder mehreren Paradigmen. Die Karte kann auch in der wissenschaftlichen Ausbildung und Forschung verwendet werden: Geschichten und Fakten, die Inhalt und Beziehungen zwischen wissenschaftlichen Paradigmen illustrieren, kÃ¶nnen dargestellt werden.",

The figures whose migrations are traced are remarkably varied: from the Greek mathematician Pythagoras to the American Jazz Age entertainer Al Jolson, from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius to the Gothic painter Henry Fuseli, and from the composer Carl Maria von Weber to the father of sexuality studies, Havelock Ellis. \n\n<br><br>\n\nBirthplaces, represented by blue dots, are connected by arcs to places of death, denoted by red dots. The animation reveals how increased concentrations of death places indicate how different cultural centers rise and fall in importance: for instance, how Paris and London supplant the dominance of Rome, how New York pulls Europeans from their places of birth, and how America’s west coast lures Easterners to cross plains and mountains with promises of a new life.

Gruppen von Zeitschriften, die auf der Karte die Disziplinen reprÃ¤sentieren, wurden mithilfe einer Metrik definiert, die auf einer Kombination der bibliografischen Kopplung von Literaturverweisen und Stichwortwortvektoren basiert. Eine dreidimensionale Anordnung der Disziplinen (Gruppen von Zeitschriften) weist diesen Disziplinen einen Bereich zu, der dann mithilfe einer Mercator-Projektion entfaltet wird, um eine zweidimensionale Version der Karte zu erstellen. Eine Vorhersage darÃ¼ber, wie sich die Struktur der Wissenschaft in naher Zukunft Ã¤ndern kann, wurde erzeugt, indem die VerÃ¤nderung der Verbindungen der verschiedenen Regionen der Karte im Laufe der Zeit ausgewertet wurde.

Die ersten zwei BÃ¤nde sind ausschlieÃŸlich chronologisch geordnet, so dass die rechte Seite der Ellipse einem Zeitstrahl gleicht.

Die kreisfÃ¶rmige Anordnung des Textes schafft einen semantischen Raum, in dem jedes der im Text vorkommenden WÃ¶rter seinen festen Platz hat. Namen von Einzelpersonen erscheinen entlang der AuÃŸenseite, da sie normalerweise nur an ein oder zwei Textstellen vorkommen, und Konzepte, die fÃ¼r die Wissenschaft zu allen Zeiten gelÃ¤ufig waren (z.B. System, Theorie, Experiment) werden zur Mitte hin gezogen, da sie Ã¼berall im Text erwÃ¤hnt werden. Noch faszinierender ist, dass Themen, die der Hauptschwerpunkt bestimmter Fachgebiete waren, sich weder in der NÃ¤he der spezifischen RÃ¤nder noch der allgemeinen Mitte befinden, sondern in einem lokalen, thematischen Streifen dazwischen: z.B. Verstand, Wissen und Konzept wÃ¤hrend der philosophischen AnfÃ¤nge der Wissenschaft; Mond, Erde, Sonne und Sterne ein wenig spÃ¤ter; ElektrizitÃ¤t, Licht und KrÃ¤fte in den jÃ¼ngeren physikalischen Wissenschaften; und Tiere, Krankheit, Entwicklung und Gehirn in den jÃ¼ngeren Biowissenschaften.

Die Karte zeigt Co-Export-Strukturen von 775 Industrieprodukten, die von 132 LÃ¤ndern von 1998 bis 2000 exportiert wurden. Technisch ausgereiftere Produkte befinden sich in einem dichten Kern der Struktur, wÃ¤hrend technisch einfache Produkte in der dÃ¼nn besiedelten Peripherie zu finden sind. ErfahrungsgemÃ¤ÃŸ verÃ¤ndern LÃ¤nder ihre Position im Produktraum, indem sie Waren entwickeln, die Ã¤hnlich denen sind, die sie derzeit produzieren. Die meisten LÃ¤nder kÃ¶nnen den Kern nur erreichen, indem sie groÃŸe Entfernungen Ã¼berqueren. Damit lÃ¤sst sich vielleicht erklÃ¤ren, warum EntwicklungslÃ¤nder MÃ¼he haben, wettbewerbsfÃ¤higere Exporte zu entwickeln und es nicht schaffen, zu den Einkommensniveaus der reichen LÃ¤nder aufzuschlieÃŸen.

Gapminder, a non-profit foundation based in Stockholm, has developed classroom materials to stimulate an interest in using statistics to understand the world. This sorting game developed by Mattias Lindgren based on an idea by Paula Cooper was designed to replace devastating myths with a fact-based worldview. Students are given a number of “country cards.” They are asked to group the cards in a way that reflects the development level of these countries. Any grouping—sorting into two or more groups or arranging them into one line—is fine. Next, students are asked to explain how they arranged the cards—does the sorting reflect incomes, health, or development in a more general sense? Subsequently, the teacher introduces the <em>Gapminder World Map</em> shown here: The Y-axis is life expectancy (increases bottom-up); the X-axis is income per person (less than $500 per year on left to more than $50,000 on right). Each bubble is a country, color-coded by continent and size-coded by country population. When the sorting is compared with the placement of bubbles on the map, are there any surprises?

Seine mathematischen Beweise, welche die Erde als Kugel beschreiben, sind bis heute anerkannt, obwohl er diese Kugel fÃ¤lschlicherweise als Mittelpunkt eines Universums ansah, das tÃ¤glich um sie herum rotieren wÃ¼rde. Diese Karte stammt aus einer Ausgabe der <i>Cosmographia</i>, die in Ulm, Deutschland, verÃ¶ffentlicht wurde â€“ recht bald, nachdem PtolemÃ¤us' bedeutenden Arbeiten, die wÃ¤hrend des Mittelalters verloren gegangen waren, wÃ¤hrend der Renaissance wiederentdeckt worden waren. Diese Ulmer Ausgabe von 1482 unterscheidet sich auffÃ¤llig von vorhergehenden italienischen Ausgaben, weil sie als Holzschnitt anstatt als Kupferstich gedruckt wurde. Die Karte zeigt Afrika als ausgedehnte Landmasse im SÃ¼den und den Indischen Ozean als ein von Land umschlossenes GewÃ¤sser. ",

    "description": "Richard Klavans and Kevin W. Boyack are known for groundbreaking maps of science that serve as platforms for planning and evaluation. This work, their eighth contribution to the exhibit, shows several relationships between the worlds of altruism and science using maps of the two spaces. The map of altruism was created using text from the websites of 125,000 non-profit organizations (NPOs) in the U.S. using domain names provided by GuideStar USA, Inc. MALLET topic modeling was run on nearly 4 million web pages, and the mission-related topics were located in a two-dimensional space. The map shows the locations of nearly 100,000 NPOs overlaid on this topic space. A map of science was created from 43 million Scopus documents using a two-step process: documents were grouped into 156,000 clusters using a direct citation methodology, and the clusters were mapped using textual similarity. Together, the results demonstrate that, while most NPO efforts support day-to-day activities related to altruistic missions, a surprising amount is used to fund scientific research, particularly in topics related to innovation, environment, and medicine. In contrast, very little NPO effort is used to support research in altruistic missions dealing with different aspects of childhood development. Funding of more research to increase our understanding of these areas could lead to revolutionary advances that parallel those made in technology and medicine in recent years.",

Hardy, der Datenanalytiker Shashikant Penumarthy und die Informatikerin Katy BÃ¶rner entwickeln Infrastrukturen zur Analyse, Modellierung und Kartierung umfangreicher akademischer DatensÃ¤tze. Als Beispiel dieser Arbeit wird hier ein Datensatz gezeigt, welcher 113 Jahre der wissenschaftlichen Zeitschrift <i>Physical Review</i> umfasst. Die Visualisierung zeigt alle 389.899 Artikel, die in 720 BÃ¤nden von 11 Zeitschriften zwischen 1893 und 2005 verÃ¶ffentlicht wurden und gruppiert sie mithilfe der Kodes des 1975 eingefÃ¼hrten Physik- und Astronomie-Klassifikationsschemas (Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme-PACS) ein. Die 91.762 von 1893 bis 1976 verÃ¶ffentlichten Artikel nehmen das linke Drittel der Karte ein. Die 217.503 Artikel von 1977 bis 2000, fÃ¼r die zum Teil Zitations- und PACS-Daten vorhanden sind, befinden sich auf dem mittleren Drittel der Karte, und die 80.634 Artikel von 2001 bis 2005, fÃ¼r die vollstÃ¤ndige Zitations- und PACS-Daten vorhanden sind, fÃ¼llen das letzte Drittel der Karte aus. Ãœber diese Referenzkarte wurden alle Zitationen aus den im Jahre 2005 publizierten Arbeiten Ã¼berlagert â€“ die gelben Linien von den PACS-Kodes der hÃ¶chsten Ebene zu den frÃ¼heren Jahren. In jedem Jahr sagt Thomson Reuters drei NobelpreistrÃ¤ger fÃ¼r Physik auf der Grundlage von ZitationszÃ¤hlungen, hocheinflussreichen Arbeiten und Entdeckungen oder Themen, die einer speziellen Anerkennung wert sind, voraus. Die kleinen Nobelpreismedaillen zeigen alle Arbeiten, die einen Nobelpreis gewinnen kÃ¶nnten an, und die groÃŸe Medaille hebt die korrekte Vorhersage von Thomson Reuters hervor. ",

    "description": "Designed by data visualization designer Moritz Stefaner, data analyst Mario Diwersy, and research strategist Christian Herzog, this map characterizes the portfolios of 23 funding agencies active in 2012. Publicly available data on funded projects was downloaded and each project was classified using the Research Condition and Disease Classification (RCDC) by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Using the 50 most frequently used RCDC classifications, a map was calculated based on their co-occurrence and is shown top-left. In this map, the circle sizes represent the share of funding spent on the respective topic. Classifications that co-occur frequently on grants are placed in close proximity. This RCDC topic map was then used to characterize the funding profile of the 23 agencies that can be seen as small-multiple visualization in the lower right. In each funder map, the circle area size shows the proportion of funding spent on each topic by that funder. Funding agencies are placed according to the location of their funding focus on the topic map: those that focus on ‘Bioengineering’ on the left, ‘Breast Cancer’ on top, etc. Visually, the maps resemble petri dishes—not only a nod to the theme of research, but also a conceptual anchor to make the graphic more memorable. The map can be used to visually compare funding portfolios or to identify and coordinate joint funding opportunities.",

    "description": "This macroscope was created by Kalev H. Leetaru, an expert on big data and global society. It uses as its source material, quite literally, the news of the world. The visualization explores how new stories group countries into distinct clusters, creating an inherent geographic network structure over the planet akin to “communities” as seen through the eyes of the world’s presses. In essence, for every monitored news article published anywhere in the world, it compiles a list of the other countries also mentioned in those articles. \n\n<br><br>\n\nIt is important to note that this is not how often coverage from a country mentions other countries; it is how often coverage from any country in the world that is about that country mentions other countries. In other words, it is about context. \n\n<br><br>\n\nCountries that are frequently mentioned together might reflect geographic proximity, but also economic and political ties, or joint involvement in a major international event. Blue incoming lines indicate countries where at least 10% of the coverage mentioning the source country also mentioned the selected country. Red outgoing lines indicate countries where at least 10% of the coverage mentioning the selected country also mentioned the destination country. \n\n<br><br>\n\nThe size and number of energy pulses moving along the line indicate the percentage of co-occurring mentions. In a given week, nearly every country is mentioned alongside of every other country at least once, so the visualization uses the cutoff of 10% to highlight only the strongest relationships.

This essential truth becomes readily apparent when viewing <em>Earth</em>, the work of software engineer Cameron Beccario. \n\n<br><br>\n\nUsing data from the Global Forecast System, <em>Earth</em> visualizes worldwide weather patterns using animated wind streams, color coded according to velocity, that sweep across a three-dimensional globe. Truly interactive, the visualization allows the user to spin the globe and zoom in on a desired location. Tapping on that location will then bring up further information about exact coordinates, wind speed, and temperature, with all information updated every three hours. \n\n<br><br>\n\nThe world itself may be seen from different perspectives, as the visualization offers nine different projections, such as conic equidistant, stereographic, or Waterman Butterfly. When Earth was first introduced in December 2013, it only visualized wind patterns. Since then, however, Beccario has increased the number of overlays to include such factors as carbon monoxide concentration, dust and sulfate extinction, along with the measured temperature. Earth also shows the perceived temperature which Beccario calls the Misery Index, borrowing a term from economics.

    "description": "<p>What does your street smell like? Humans can differentiate thousands of different odors. Yet, city officials and urban planners deal only with the management of a few bad odors. In creating <em>Smelly Maps</em>, University of Turin computer science professor Rossano Schifanella and Bell Labs researchers Luca Maria Aiello and Daniele Quercia teamed up to introduce a new stream of research that celebrates the complex aromas of our cities and makes it possible to use this information in urban design.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>To map urban smellscapes, the project team first created a lexicon of smell-related words. Then, they gathered geotagged social media posts from Flickr, Instagram, and Twitter that included smell-related words. Finally, the smells people posted about were mapped on each street segment. </p><br>\n\n\n\n<p>Click on a street to see how it smells. As you might expect, nature smells are strong near parks and animal smells dominate at the zoo. Where do you find the strongest food smells? </p><br>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about the <em>Smelly Maps</em> project, visit <a href=\"http://goodcitylife.org/smellymaps\" target=\"_blank\">http://goodcitylife.org/smellymaps</a>. </p>",

These interlinked megaregions, connected by economic ties, suggest that new kinds of geographic categories are necessary if we wish to accurately describe the functional network of flows and relationships which shape our lives in the modern world. </p><br>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Megaregions of the US</em> is the work of historical geographer Garrett Dash Nelson, a postdoctoral researcher at Dartmouth College, and Alasdair Rae, an urban and regional data analyst at the University of Sheffield in England. The colorful starbursts are made up of approximately four million lines. Each line shows the linkage of commuters between one census tract and another, with the width proportional to the number of commuters, based on data from the 2010 census. Using an algorithmic technique called <em>community detection</em> to group statistically significant clusters of related places, the map is then divided up into distinct megaregions. </p><br>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you find your own hometown, your own commute, and your new megaregion? Look for places on the map where many commutes cut across megaregional boundaries, and for other places where a single city acts as a center of gravity for commuter traffic. What might our political and planning systems look like if we made these megaregions the basis for dividing up the United States?</p>\n\n",

They found that the most influential work of a scientist’s career is randomly distributed within her body of work. That is, the highest-impact work has the same probability of falling anywhere in the sequence of papers published by a scientist. It could be the first publication, appear mid-career, or emerge last. The team coined this the random impact rule.</p><br>\n\n<p>This visualization shows the random impact rule in all its power.

Mapping large volumes of this sort of recurring phenomena reveals clearer and stronger footprints of structure that may not be as apparent when presented individually. Inherent in the mapping, and highlighted via the polar projection, is the circuitous nature of cyclonic patterns as they spawn in warm tropical waters and rush away from the equator, carried along by climatic forces ultimately tied to the rotation of the planet itself. When viewed broadly in temporal volume and geographic scale, the cyclonic structure of individual hurricanes is echoed by a macroscopic view of this planetary phenomenon, forming one large “hurricane.” This fractal-like repeating pattern is a reminder of the repeating order found throughout the universe.

    "description": "Articles about people in Wikipedia include many social cues about a particular person. In the English Wikipedia there is a category called “Living People” which includes articles of people currently alive. To construct the social network of living people, computer scientists Peter A. Gloor and Keiichi Nemoto collected each article’s contents and extracted the internal links to other living people articles. Similar to the Google page rank algorithm, this linking structure reveals which person is more prominent from the Wikipedians’ perspective. The ratio between in-degree and out-degree was used as a metric of importance for the popularity, power, or importance of the person described in the article. Shown here are networks from eight different-language Wikipedias of people who were still living as of 2011. The geospatial regions where these languages are spoken are color-coded (see world map, table, and networks). Because the size of the original networks was too large, only people articles having more than a predefined number of incoming links are included, in addition to peripheral articles that have a direct link to them. To animate the evolution of the English Wikipedia network, living people articles were collected and analysed for different points in time. To explore the networks interactively, visit <a href=\"http://www.ickn.org/wikimaps\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.ickn.org/wikimaps</a>.",

    "description": "This map is the culmination of a six-year-long labor of love by noted physicist, visual artist, poet, and peace activist Bernard H. Porter. Porter began compiling the historical data upon which the map is based in 1932 while a fellow in radioactive research at Brown University. He then took most of the summer of 1933, working out of his parent’s home in Houlton, Maine, to compose the map’s striking visuals. The following years were spent circulating the map among prominent physicists and historians of science to verify its accuracy. The end result is a rich geography of a scientific field, one that uses mapping conventions to make understandable the way ideas move and develop over time. Ambitious in scope, the map traces the history of physics from the 6th century B.C. to the present day. Key theoretical starting points such as ‘Mechanics,’ ‘Sound,’ ‘and Light’ appear as water sources from which streams of thought emerge. Located alongside these rivers are “villages” representing figures like Isaac Newton, Alessandro Volta, Werner Heisenberg, and other major contributors to the development of physics. Surrounding it all is the map’s border, which is decorated with 24 diagrams that frequently appear in the work of physicists.",

    "description": "Soon after graphic designer Martin Vargic published his Map of the Internet on the website deviantART, it quickly caught the attention of media outlets like the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and the <em>HuffingtonPost</em>, with one writer declaring it “quite possibly the most brilliant thing ever.” With a concept inspired by Randall Munroe’s work of the same title, this map takes its visual cues from the cartographic style of <em>National Geographic</em>. The work is divided into two distinctive parts. The eastern portion, the “old world,” features software companies, gaming and entertainment companies, and media sites. The western part, the “new world,” is composed of two major continents: the northern one contains social networks, search websites, video websites, blogs, and forums; the southern continent features the major adult-oriented websites, along with sites sharing pirated movies, music, or software. At the very bottom lies the ‘Great Southern Land’ of obsolete websites and online services. Outside the main map are four smaller maps showing U.S. National Security Agency monitoring by country, the most used internet browsers, the most heavily used social networks, and the level of internet penetration by country.

    "description": "Created by digital humanities specialist Elijah Meeks and historian Walter Scheidel, ORBIS is both a schematic network of 3rd century Roman transportation and a website service that allows users to analyze and represent historical transportation. Utilizing a variety of information visualization methods, it provides functionality to find individual routes between the sites in the network as well as calculate and visualize the movement of goods and people in the aggregate by calculating all the routes to or from a selected site. This map shows examples of the various functions available on the ORBIS website used to examine the difference between Rome and London. The maps and diagrams attempt to answer the question of why London did not become one of the capitals of the Roman Empire. Using different data visualization methods, it highlights the connectivity of the Mediterranean and Roman Britain, the seasonal nature of that connectivity, the differences between movement of people compared to the movement of goods, and more general geographic principles such as Tobler’s “shriveling” of space or that the shortest route geographically is very rarely the cheapest or the fastest.

    "description": "Fans of Randall Munroe’s <em>xkcd</em> love the web comic for its combination of dazzling brilliance and laugh-out-loud observations. Underlying the humor, however, is often a message of utmost seriousness. Such is the case with this map, shown here in its entirety in the center and surrounded by zooms of several of the map’s most interesting components. Together, the map shows a meticulously detailed visualization of how economic resources are used and how they get distributed. Drawing information from over 200 separate sources, citations for which are available on the <em>xkcd</em> website, this map uses color-coded boxes to illustrate possession and expenditure, with examples ranging from the the annual cost of fish ownership to the the cost of one B-2 bomber. As is characteristic, the work is laced with humor: for instance, a cluster of blocks denoting the actual cost of one F-22 raptor—a stealth, supersonic fighter aircraft priced at $154 million—is followed by one showing the projected cost of one velociraptor—a stealth, super-deadly dinosaur made popular by Steven Spielberg’s <em>Jurassic Park</em>, priced at $1.9 million. The map also illustrates the dramatic disparity between the world’s rich and poor. Given the growing concern with economic inequality in recent years, this map has the power to serve as a tool for education and action.",

    "description": "This map by computational linguists Marc Bertin and Iana Atanassova, information scientist Vincent Larivière, and historian of science Yves Gingras looks at verb occurrences found in the citation contexts of the different sections of scientific papers. Using about 50,000 scientific papers published in the PLoS series of journals over the period 2009-2012, they analyzed the full-text citation contexts to extract verbs in the introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections. Each of the four sections tends to make use of different sets of verbs. The circle in the middle was generated using the Circos tool and is meant to support the exploration of relationships between frequently used verbs and their positions in different paper sections. The linguistic contexts in which verbs occur were extracted using the Stanford part-of-speech tagger. The right side of the map shows the linguistic citation context for two verbs. On the whole, this map provides insight on the internal organization of scientific papers through the specific verbs associated with citations appearing in the different sections.",

    "description": "Science, technology, and innovation policy researchers Luciano Kay, Alan L. Porter, Ismael Rafols, Nils Newman, and Jan L. Youtie illustrate the particular features of research and development of graphene—a new carbon-based material. The science basemap draws on data from Thomson Reuter's Journal Citation Reports of the Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index of 2009, including 61 million citation links. The patent basemap draws on data from the European Patent Office’s PATSTAT database for 2000-2006, including more than 41 million patent citation links. Both basemaps result from network visualizations of cosine-similarity matrices that reflect publication and patent citation patterns between 222 Web of Science categories and 466 International Patent Classifications (IPCs), respectively. Similar sized categories of mixed hierarchical composition were computed using the mapmaker’s own algorithm. In addition, 18 macro-disciplines—groups of subject categories—and 35 macro-patent categories—technology groups—were identified using factor analysis. The graphene overlays were generated by querying the two datasets using “graphene” and the time period 2000-2013. The resulting maps visually locate bodies of research within the sciences and technology development areas and help illustrate innovation dynamics in support of business and policy decision-making.",

    "description": "Business computer scientist Achim Oberg and sociologists Valeska P. Korff and Walter W. Powell study civil society organizations and how the entrance of scientific evaluation practices and managerial tools changes the assessment of performance. This map shows the presence of civic ideals, managerial concepts, and scientific assessments among 369 organizations actively involved in efforts at measuring social impact. For each organization, information on their scientific and managerial discourses with civic ideals was retrieved from websites using a web crawler. A total of 105 keywords were identified as relevant for an organization’s position vis-à-vis the three lines of discourse: civil society, science, and management. The large triangle in the middle features all organizations color coded by their dominant discourse. Key institutions are labelled. Interstitial organizations whose blending of discourses suggests they have become fluent in all three discourses are colored in yellow. Weblinks between the four linguistic communities document connections between organizations. The  triangles on the left show both: integration within and connections between discursive communities. Linkages of the pure discourse organizations and the interstitial organizations are shown in the lower left.
