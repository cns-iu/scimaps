Herman Moll (1654–1732) was known to be a Dutch geographer and cartographer, who may have lived in Germany and then settled in London, United Kingdom, in 1698. At the turn of the 17th century, Moll was the most famous map publisher in England. He was also the first cartographer to create an elegant map of England that correctly portrayed its shape. His style combined elaborate embellishment with clear, bold lettering—the latter used for important details. Moll lived in a time of great discoveries, amid the Anglo-Dutch wars to control the North Sea and the rise of the New Netherlands and North America. It was a time of great explorers and stories like those of Robert Hooke, Daniel Defoe, Jonathan Swift, Christian Huygens, and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. Moll prided himself on his work and publicly rebuked mapmakers who republished preexisting maps under new titles without having investigated their accuracy or completion, as this could have proved fatal in cases where known depths of water and sands were omitted.
