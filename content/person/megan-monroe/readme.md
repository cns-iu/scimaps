Megan Monroe is an assistant teaching professor in computer science at Tufts University. Previously, Monroe was a part of IBM Research, where she designed and developed visual analytics tools for a wide range of Watson technologies, including client-facing interfaces, as well as visual dashboards to enable the back-end debugging of machine learning algorithms. Monroe’s doctoral work at the University of Maryland focused on the analysis of temporal, event-based records, such as electronic health records and transaction logs. The EventFlow visualization tool that she developed has been used by Washington D.C. Children’s Hospital, the U.S. Army Pharmacovigilance Center, University of Florida’s College of Medicine, and many others. Her interests cover not only a wide range of computation, but also the application of computational thinking as a general problem-solving technique.
