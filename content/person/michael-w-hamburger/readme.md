Michael W. Hamburger is professor of geological sciences at Indiana University. His research interests center on the relation of earthquakes to global geological processes, earthquake hazards, and volcanic activity. His research in seismology and volcanology has included field investigations in Alaska, the Philippines, the South Pacific, Central Asia, and the central United States. Recent research involves the application of new satellite surveying techniques to studies of deformation of the Earthâ€™s crust in the U.S. midcontinent and in active volcanoes in the Philippines. He has also taken on a leading role in creating the U.S. Educational Seismology Network (USESN), which brings seismology research instruments into hundreds of schools across the country. Hamburger has been involved in organizing campus and community response to major natural disasters, including the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 and the Pakistan earthquake of 2005.
