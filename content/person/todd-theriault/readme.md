Todd joined CNS in 2012 as Exhibit Co-Curator and Copy Editor. With a BA in English from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and an MA in English from Miami University of Ohio, he previously spent time teaching classes on poetry, fiction, and creative writing to students at Miami University, University of Cincinnati, Xavier University, and Indiana University.

Todd is an invaluable writer and editor for the Center. Just about everything that's published by CNS makes it to Todd's desk first.
