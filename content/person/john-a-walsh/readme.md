John A. Walsh holds an MA and a PhD in English from Indiana University—where he works as an assistant professor in the Department of Information and Library Science, School of Informatics and Computing. His research focuses on electronic textuality and the nature of the document in the digital age, with a particular focus on the relationship among graphics and text, the materiality of digital documents, and design as information. Walsh explores the evolution of the document, the book, and the literary text—both born-digital new media texts and digital representations of prior texts in the Swinburne Project, the Chymistry of Isaac Newton, and Comic Book Markup Language, among others.
