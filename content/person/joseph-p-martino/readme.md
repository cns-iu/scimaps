Joseph P. Martino earned a BA in physics at Miami University, an MS in electrical engineering at Purdue University, and a PhD in mathematics at Ohio State University. He then served in the U.S. Air Force for 22 years, in which he was a member of the Plans Staff of both the Air Force Avionics Laboratory and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research; he was also chief of the Environmental Analysis Division of the Air Force Office of Research and Analysis. In these positions, he was responsible for preparing the forecasts of critical technologies for future weapons systems. After retiring as a full-bird colonel, Martino was a senior research scientist at the University of Dayton Research Institute, where from 1975 to 1993 he conducted research for the Army Missile Command, Martin Marietta Materials, AT&T, IT&T, the Hobart Corporation, and other sponsors. He also created and taught graduate-level engineering courses on technological forecasting in R&D planning, business, and government and methods of anticipating the social, economic, and environmental consequences of new technology. Martino is the author of Technological Forecasting for Decision Making (1972) and Research and Development Project Selection (1995). He is now a private consultant in technology management and a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
