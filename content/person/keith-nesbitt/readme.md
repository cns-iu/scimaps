Keith V. Nesbitt is a senior lecturer in the School of Design, Communication, and Information Technology at the University of Newcastle, Australia. Previously, he worked at Charles Sturt University in Bathurst. He also spent 10 years at the applied research facility of Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd., where he applied advanced computing technologies to a cross-section of business domains, including exploration, mining, manufacture, logistics, and finance. He studied medicine before developing an interest in computing and subsequently receiving a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Newcastle and a master's in computing and a PhD in computer science from Sydney University. His doctoral work investigated new conceptual models for designing multisensory user interfaces and included the design and evaluation of visual, auditory, and haptic displays for finding patterns in stock market data. Nesbitt summarizes his work as tool building that helps people find useful patterns in data. Related to this, Nesbitt also studies how the mind works and how people create and use ideas. His current scientific interests include designing multisensory displays, perception and cognition, complex systems, software engineering, user-interface design, and conceptual modeling.
