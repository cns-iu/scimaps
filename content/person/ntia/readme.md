The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is an agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce, established in 1978. Prior to NTIA's inception, the executive branch had established the Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTP) in order to spearhead the administration's communications policy in certain areas, most notably cable television. The NTIA succeeded this unit, combining the responsibilities and mission of the OTP with those of the Commerce Department's Office of Telecommunications. The agency is now the principal advisor to the president on both domestic and international telecommunications and information policy activities. The NTIA also manages the federal use of the spectrum; performs cutting-edge telecommunications research and engineering, such as resolving technical telecommunications issues for the federal government and private sector; administers infrastructure and public telecommunications facilities grants; and operates the research and engineering Institute for Telecommunication Sciences in Colorado.
