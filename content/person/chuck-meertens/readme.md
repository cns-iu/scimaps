Charles Meertens is the facility director and interim president of UNAVCO in Boulder, Colorado. UNAVCO provides GPS project support, technology development, and data management and archiving services to the UNAVCO research community—supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF)—and to NASA's Global GPS Network (GGN). He is also one of the co-principal investigators on GEON (the Geosciences Network), which began as a collaborative research project funded under the NSF Information Technology Research (ITR) program. GEON is conducting fundamental research toward developing a cyberinfrastructure for the earth sciences. Meertens is actively engaged in education and outreach activities at UNAVCO, particularly in the areas of visualization and data access. He received a PhD in geophysics from the University of Colorado in 1987 and subsequently conducted GPS research in earthquake, volcanic, and tectonic processes there, at the University of Utah, and at UCAR/UNAVCO (while the UNAVCO facility was still part of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research).
