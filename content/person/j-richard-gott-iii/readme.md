J. Richard Gott III is a professor of astrophysics at Princeton University working on cosmology and general relativity. He discovered an exact solution to Einstein’s field equations for two moving cosmic strings—a solution of particular interest as it would allow time travel to the past. He has studied the topology of large-scale structure in the universe, and with Mario Juric coauthored the paper "Map of the Universe.
