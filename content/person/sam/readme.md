Sam Learner is a visual journalist and data visualization developer from Chicago, currently based in New York. He works as a graphics journalist on the Financial Times’ visual storytelling team, where he has been part of award-winning stories covering topics such as the war in Ukraine, large language models, quantum computing, and the looming threat of space debris. He previously created a number of open-source visualizations, web pages, and tools, usually with the goal of making public data more practically accessible to a wide audience. The rivers, bridges, and hills of Pittsburgh inspired him to build this tool while he was living there in 2021.
