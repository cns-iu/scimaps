David Rumsey is president of Cartography Associates, a digital publishing company based in San Francisco, and director of Luna Imaging, a provider of enterprise software for online image collections. He was a founding member of Yale Research Associates in the Arts, a group of artists working with electronic technologies. He subsequently became associate director of the American Society for Eastern Arts in San Francisco. Later, he entered a 20-year career in real estate development and finance, during which he had a long association with the General Atlantic Holding Company of New York and served as president and director of several subsidiaries. General Atlantic eventually became the Atlantic Trust, a Bermuda-based philanthropic foundation that is now one of the world's largest charities. Rumsey retired from real estate in 1995 and founded Cartography Associates, beginning a third career as a digital publisher, online library builder, and software entrepreneur.
