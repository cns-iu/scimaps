"Noé Gaumont defended his thesis on communities and groups detection in temporal graphs in 2016. Temporal graphs is a formalism that extends graph theory to study interactions in face-to-face contacts, emails, phone calls, IP traffic, etc. In all of them, an interaction is characterized by two entities and a time interval. Gaumont’s work defines new metrics that mingle topological and temporal information to quantify key characteristics of a temporal graph – or a subset – and therefore help better understand its specificity. He applied his work to twitter during the 2017 French presidential election and reconstructed the temporal political communities."
