Danyel Fisher is a researcher in the VIBE (Visualization and Interaction for Business and Entertainment) group at Microsoft Research. He received an MS from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2000 and a PhD in computer science from the University of California, Irvine, in 2004. His research centers on using qualitative and quantitative social network analysis and visualization to understand the ways that people in online groups interactâ€”via e-mail, Usenet, blogs, and contemporary social software. He uses these results to design the next generation of interfaces for social software, as well as to address broader questions of social structure. His recent research looks at visualizing large data sets created from human activities, including Web server logs.
