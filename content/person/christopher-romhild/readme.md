Christoph Römhild studied theology at universities in Berlin and Hamburg and at a Jewish college in London. Initially, he worked as a full-time software developer before becoming a Lutheran pastor in 2003. After some months at the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD), where he developed a system for email response management, he moved to Hamburg and became a pastor at the North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church. Since 2009, Römhild has been the local project manager for the EKD-run Geistreich project, a best-practice portal for Protestant church practitioners aiming to strengthen cooperation and communication across Europe.
