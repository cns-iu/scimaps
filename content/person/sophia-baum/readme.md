**Sophia Baum** joined the Complexity Science Hub as a project intern. Holding a bachelorâ€™s degree in physics from Heidelberg University, she is currently pursuing a master's degree in physics from the University of Vienna with her work at CSH providing the basis of her master's thesis. She is researching shock propagation in the network of global food trade and production, exploring the dynamics of the system and examining countries' adaptation strategies. Her research aims to not only understand the impact of shocks propagating, but also how losses can be mitigated and how countries can enhance resilience in complex economic systems.
