Edmund (Ned) Talley received his PhD in neuroscience from the University of Virginia. He is a program director for basic research in synaptic transmission at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). His interest in textual analysis and visual analytics initially resulted from NIH strategic planning efforts in which the need for better analytic tools for assessing NIH funding became apparent.
