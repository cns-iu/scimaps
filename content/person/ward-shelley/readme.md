Ward Shelley holds a BA from Eckerd College and an MFA from New York University. He is an artist identified with the Williamsburg scene in Brooklyn, New York, and specializes in large projects that freely mix architecture and performance. Shelley also works on a series of diagrammatic paintings and graphical chronologies that illustrate the interweaving of historical narratives about art and culture. Shelley has exhibited in more than 10 countries, and his work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, and the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art (within the Brooklyn Museum). Shelley received a painting and sculpture award from the Joan Mitchell Foundation and has been a fellow of the American Academy in Rome since 2006. He has received NYFA and NEA fellowships in the sculpture and new media categories, a Bessie Award for installation art, and grants from the Jerome Foundation and the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. He is represented by the Pierogi Gallery in Brooklyn and teaches at Parsons The New School for Design in New York.
