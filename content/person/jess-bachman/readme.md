Jess Bachman holds a BA in communications and media systems from the University of Massachusetts–Amherst. Bachman began his career by first mapping the federal government’s budget, after which he began to release the Death and Taxes map for the years 2007, 2008, and 2009—each version increasingly complex and aesthetically refined as well as more accurate due to more expansive and updated content. With the launch of the 2009 version, Bachman migrated the map operation online to WallStats.com, which continues to serve as the archive for all his informational design and posters. Bachman now specializes in infographics, creating popular and insightful visualizations for corporate and private projects. Since 2011, he has been the creative director of Visual.ly, a data visualization company.
