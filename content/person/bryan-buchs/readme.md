When **Bryan Buchs** learned the keyboard shortcut for “view source,” he immediately started picking apart websites to learn how they were built. 25+ years later he hasn’t stopped. As the Internet has evolved, so has his skill set. He is most proud of his ability to quickly learn and apply new skills and techniques. These days his primary focus is on crafting code and websites that are clean, concise, resilient, and accessible. Bryan lives in Shorewood, WI, with his wife, daughter, and two cats. His hobbies are cooking, reading, and rooting for the Milwaukee Bucks.
