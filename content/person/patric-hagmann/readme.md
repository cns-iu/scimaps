Patric Hagmann earned his medical degree from the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. In 2001, he completed his education with a postgraduate program in biomedical engineering at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). From 2001 to 2005, he worked at the Signal Processing Institute (ITS) as a research assistant and also conducted studies at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging of Harvard Medical School. In 2005, he received a PhD from the School of Computer and Communication Sciences at EPFL for his work entitled “From Diffusion MRI to Brain Connectomics.” Hagmann works at the University Hospital of Lausanne and also conducts research at EPFL and ITS. His current research includes the theoretical foundations of diffusion MRI and its mathematical representation; the relationship between the diffusion MRI signal and brain axonal trajectories, known as tractography or fiber tracking; the mathematical representation of brain connectivity, or the brain connectome, and its architecture; and comparative neuroanatomy between different classes of subjects.
