Niko McGlashan holds a master of architecture degree from the University of Toronto and graduated with honors. Combined with his undergraduate education in environment and urban sustainability and geographic analysis, he yields a multidisciplinary and multiscalar approach to complex urban problems. Niko's research is heavily invested in computation, data, and design. He has performed extensive climate research at both the Center for Landscape Research at the University of Toronto and the Urban Water Research Center at Ryerson University. He has investigated the accumulation of contaminants in urban tributary networks, leveraged generative design to propose adaptive climate urbanism, and developed a software toolkit for designers to automate the LEED, WELL, and AIA sustainability standards during the architectural design process. At the Center, Niko researches urban equity and data capture, and he develops civic technology for the public, architects, and planners.
