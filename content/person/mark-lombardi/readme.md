Mark Lombardi (1951-2000) held a BA in art history from Syracuse University. While still an undergraduate, Lombardi was chief researcher for a 1973 exhibit entitled From Teapot Dome to Watergate, a multimedia collage whose elements focused on various U.S. governmental scandals, then motivated by the ongoing Watergate scandal. That work led to a curatorship at the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, after which Lombardi became a reference librarian for the Fine Arts Department in the Houston Public Library system, where he started a regional artist archive. He then worked in gallery ownership, relocated to New York City, and ultimately developed a following for his carefully researched and constructed narrative structures of major political and financial scandals. Unlike many works of art, his maps were not created as depictions of hypothetical or imaginary events but were rendered according to facts derived from mainstream publications, such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times. Lombardi would carefully organize these facts into a handwritten database of over 14,000 cross-referenced index cards. He then iteratively composed flowcharts in colored pencil and graphite on paper. Following his death in 2000, the posthumous retrospective of his work, Mark Lombardi: Global Network, traveled to nine museums from 2003 to 2005.
