Richard Buckminster "Bucky" Fuller was an inventor, philosopher, architect, engineer, cartographer, geometrician, author, and applied futurist. He is best known for the invention of the geodesic dome and the third allotrope of carbon. The “buckminsterfullerene” was named in his honor. As one of the most original thinkers of the 20th century, he was called by Marshall McLuhan "the Leonardo da Vinci of our time." Fuller developed an approach to envisioning long-term trends and design artifacts for a global, sustainable environment; he called it Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science. Fuller shaped this approach, or program, with the purpose of anticipating and solving humanity's most urgent survival problems through technologies inspired by nature's design. Fuller authored 28 books, thousands of articles, and hundreds of trend charts. He was awarded 28 U.S. patents and received 47 honorary doctorates.
