**Martin Bruckner**, senior researcher at ETH ZÃ¼rich and WU Wien, specializes in modeling biomass conversion networks. He develops and applies multi-regional input-output models to analyze socio-economic biomass metabolism, its drivers, environmental impacts, risks, and dependencies. His research covers the water-food-energy nexus, supply chain risks, the global environmental impacts of consumption and production, dietary changes, food waste reduction, and climate risks in agricultural supply chains.
