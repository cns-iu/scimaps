Marc A. Smith worked as a sociologist and senior researcher at Microsoft Research, specializing in the social organization of online communities, when he designed this map. He is the coeditor of Communities in Cyberspace (Routledge), a collection of essays exploring the ways identity, interaction, and social order develop in online groups. Smith's research focuses on the ways group dynamics change when they take place in social cyberspaces, and his goal is to visualize these social cyberspaces, mapping and measuring their structures, dynamics, and life cycles. In support of this research, he directed the setup of the Netscan social network analysis infrastructure. Marc received a BS in international area studies from Drexel University in Philadelphia in 1988, an MPhil in social theory from Cambridge University in 1990, and a PhD in sociology from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2001.
