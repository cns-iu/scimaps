Paul M. G. Otlet (1868–1944) was a Belgian lawyer, bibliographer, and internationalist. He pioneered the field of what is today known as information science, which he first called “documentation.” Otlet is often considered the father of information management. In her 2002 documentary, The Man Who Wanted to Classify the World, Franзoise Levie chronicles Otlet’s obsession to categorize, encode, and unify published materials from all over the world. His classification system can be seen as the predecessor of hypertext. Otlet imagined a modern library with no physical books, the contents of which could be viewed onscreen. After 1918, long before the development of the Internet, Otlet had coined and used terms such as “web of knowledge,” “link,” and “knowledge network” to describe his vision for a central repository of all human knowledge.
