John McHale (1922–1978) was an artist, sociologist, and the author of numerous texts on the impact of culture, technology, and mass communications. Producing work that ranged from fine arts and graphics to television and film, he was a founder of the Independent Group, a British movement that originated Pop Art, which itself grew out of a fascination with American mass culture and post-WWII technologies. In the 1960s, while on the design faculty of Southern Illinois University–Carbondale, McHale was an associate of R. Buckminster Fuller. As collaborators, McHale and Fuller coauthored a number of reports that were part of the World Design Science Decade documents, which included large-scale diagrams of unique scope, such as the one shown here.
