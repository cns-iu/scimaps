In this iteration, you will find interactive visualizations that disrupt old habits of seeing, that challenge our common patterns of perception in order that we might see things anew.Â Looking at wellness through the lens of social, economic, and infrastructure factors, for example, opens up ideas for how policy and research can improve health. Looking at income segregation at the level of the individual visitor within the landscape captures the dimension of movement. A shift in perspective can result in a richer and more multifaceted understanding of the subject at hand, whether that subject is egg shape or the motion of the stars.
