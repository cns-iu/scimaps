title: Macroscopes for Interacting with Science
---
Interactive data visualizations, or macroscopes, have great potential as tools for exploring, understanding, and communicating science. They empower individuals to interact with data and to make their very own maps. This iteration features macroscopes that:

*   Track wind speed, temperature, pollution, and weather patterns in real time and worldwide.
*   Organize 20 years of reports from four major research institutions, grouping and arranging them based on topics, popularity, and publication date.
*   Illustrate connections between countries based on local news stories in more than 100 languages.
*   Chart the movements of people and changing cultural influences by tracking the birth and death locations of 120,000 individuals over the past 2,600 years.
