title: Macroscopes for Playing with Scale
---
If you are lost in the details of a problem, some say you cannot see the forest for the trees. Macroscopes, however, allow you to view both the forest and the trees. Macroscopes can even provide a view of that forest from outer space, and then zoom in to show you one individual leaf. The macroscopes in this iteration are especially good at conveying a sense of scale and navigating through data at different scales. They include some of the largest data sets imaginable, like the cosmos and the history of the world. Yet, they also let you focus on an individual detail, like the most important paper in one scientistâ€™s career.
