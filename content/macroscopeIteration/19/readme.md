title: Macroscopes as Digital Atlases
iteration: 19
---
This year’s collection of macroscopes serve as digital atlases—collections of maps, charts, and other graphical representations that attempt a global view of a scientific subject. Some include reference maps where data is placed within a coordinate system to visualize spatial relationships between entities. Others illuminate particular techniques like machine learning, which is critical for building the large, data-informed digital atlases of today. And, like the best cartographic and anatomical atlases, these macroscopes are engaging, well organized, easy to use, and support both informed query and broad exploration.
