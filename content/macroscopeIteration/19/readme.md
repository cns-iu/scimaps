iteration: 19

Digital atlases are collections of maps and charts that focus on a single theme. The power of a digital atlas is that it makes comparison within a collection easier. By linking related visualizations and datasets, patterns and relationships emerge. This iteration includes digital atlases that address spatial equity, housing, coronavirus research, and machine learning techniques. Like the best cartographic and anatomical atlases, they are engaging, insightful, and easy to use.
