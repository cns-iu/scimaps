title: Macroscopes for Ensuring our Well-being
---
We make decisions every day that affect our personal health, safety, and happiness. Each of these macroscopes provides a glimpse into data on a topic of great importance to our collective well-being.

  

How we handle climate change, feed our bodies, address public health emergencies, and prevent violence have huge implications for human survival. Use these four macroscopes to explore the data behind the headlines, to develop a deeper understanding of each issue, and perhaps to devise creative solutions for the problems we face together.
