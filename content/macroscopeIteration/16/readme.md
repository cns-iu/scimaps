title: Macroscopes for Harnessing the Power of Data
---
Macroscopes gather vast amounts of information, analyze it, and visualize it to gain clear insights from complex data. To do so, they use powerful algorithms. This iteration highlights different methods for analyzing and visualizing a dataset: scrollytelling, network analysis, dimensionality reduction, and natural language processing. Each can be used to create data portals of great power, utility, and beauty.
