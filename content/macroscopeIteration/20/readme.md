title: Macroscopes for a Global Future
iteration: 20
---
This group of visualizations has a distinctly global scope and a big picture bias. They provide a planetary perspective, showcasing large and complex datasets. Multifactor analysis teases out the effects of indirect dependencies as well as more visible relationships. Their interfaces are intuitive, allowing you to focus on the topic rather than the tool. To flourish in the future, we must recognize that all fates are connected. Macroscopes with a global perspective can reinforce this point of view and help us chart a path into the future.
