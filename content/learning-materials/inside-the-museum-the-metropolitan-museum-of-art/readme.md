## Inside the Museum: The Metropolitan Museum of Art

Do you like Where's Waldo? If you do, then you'll love this complement to the [Metropolitan Museum of Art Family Map](http://scimaps.org/mapdetail/metropolitan_museum__140) in this exhibit! Illustrator John Kerschbaum and the Met’s Senior Publishing and Creative Manager Masha Turchinsky created this Inside the Museum map that emphasizes the vastness of the Metropolitan’s holdings and spaces. It is intentionally jam-packed with approximately 3,000 illustrations of objects, which were researched, sketched, and drawn over a period of three years.\
\
The illustrated poster conveys the endless opportunities to discover and connect the treasures of the Museum. A scavenger hunt game in the border offers fun clues that remind visitors that art rewards close looking. Can you find the elephant with a clock on its back? Do you see the dog, dressed like a man, barking at an old black cat? Where is William, the MET’s unofficial mascot? Compile your score and look up your rating. Finally, plan your trip well and come back often to put the “art” in “smart.” The map is available for free at all Museum information desks and online here.
