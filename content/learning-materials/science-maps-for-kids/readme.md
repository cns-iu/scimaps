## Science Maps for Kids

The hands-on science maps for kids invite children to see, explore, and understand science from above. One map shows our world and the places where science is practiced or researched. The other shows major areas of science and their complex interrelationships.\
\
Both maps also appear in the Illuminated Diagram display by Kevin Boyack, Richard Klavans, John Burgoon, Peter Kennard, and W. Bradford Paley. Watercolor paintings by Fileve Palmer were digitally added by Elisha Hardy to make different continents as well as different areas of science more tangible.\
\
Children and adults alike are invited to help solve the puzzle by placing major scientists, inventors, and inventions at their proper places. Start by selecting either of the two maps. Decide if you want to place famous people or major inventions first. Turn the map over when you are done and start again. Look for the many hints hidden in the drawings to find the perfect place for each puzzle piece. What other inventors and inventions do you know? Where would your favorite science teachers and science experiments go? What area of science do you want to explore next.
