  Foreign US Patent Holders \[WorldProcessor #294]\

  Sculptor and media artist Ingo Günther has mapped social, scientific, political, and economic data on globes as navigational guides in a globalized world. Using data from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, this globe represents half of all patents in the United States—namely those registered to foreign holders. Countries with more than 1,000 patents registered in the U.S. are indicated by name, with the point size of the representative text scaled according to the square root of the total number of U.S. patents held. If the total number of domestically held U.S. patents were indicated according to this logic, the entire surface of the globe would be covered.

  Zones of Invention – Patters of Patents \[WorldProcessor #286]\

  Sculptor and media artist Ingo Günther has mapped social, scientific, political, and economic data on globes as navigational guides in a globalized world. This WorldProcessor globe plots the total number of patents granted worldwide according to statistics published by the World Intellectual Property Organization. The data graph begins in 1883 with just under 50,000, reaches 650,000 in 1993, and rapidly approaches 1.5 million in 2002. Geographic regions where countries offer environments conducive to fostering innovation are represented by topology. Additionally, nations where residents are granted an average of 500 or more U.S. patents per year are called out in red by their respective averages in the years after 2000. Almost half of the 6 million patents are owned by Japanese and U.S. entities. To explore other WorldProcessor globes, visit <http://worldprocessor.org>.




  Shape of Science – Science Universe\

  Sculptor and media artist Ingo Günther has mapped social, scientific, political, and economic data on globes as navigational guides in a globalized world. This representation of the space that science would occupy when mapped out on a sphere is one of several prototypes for a tangible sculpture titled “Shape of Science.” The concept of a three-dimensional shape of science is based on the research of Richard Klavans and Kevin Boyack, who through spatial and quantifiable means, notably co-citation networks and network analysis, identify the connectivities and relative flows of inquiry within the world of science. This version differentiates each of the 13 fields of science stylistically. The names of the fields are written along their border.
