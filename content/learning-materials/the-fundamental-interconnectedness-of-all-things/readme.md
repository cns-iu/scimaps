How can we fully explore different disciplinary perspectives? This dynamic version of The Fundamental Interconnectedness of All Things, also developed by bibliometrics specialists Matthew Richardson, Judith Kamalski, Sarah Huggett, and Andrew Plume, allows you to forge your own path through the interconnected domains of knowledge. The map positions 19,562 journals according to their citation relationships using a journal–journal citation matrix from Elsevier’s Scopus database. Journal nodes are colored using a simplified version of the Scopus journal classification system, and journals in any given subject can be seen to cluster together.\
\
The network was laid out using the Force Atlas 2 algorithm in Gephi 0.8 beta, which draws related journals towards one another in the map until a balanced state is achieved. Any area can be selected by clicking on the map or label to find out more about it. Themed stories above and below the map show what we can learn from animals and the importance of accidents for discovery. The scientific fields these stories illustrate are highlighted on the map and show how multiple areas of knowledge can be relevant to a particular topic—and how collaboration across subjects can help to drive new knowledge.
