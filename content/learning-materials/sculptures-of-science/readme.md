## Sculptures of Science

With the idea of making the history of science tangible, curator Katy Börner and artist Carrie Longley collaborated on the creation of a 3-foot tall, clay sculpture that gives science a physical, three-dimensional form which invites playful interaction.\
\
The sculpture embodies the idea that science, like mushrooms, can grow in many directions. Mushroom-shaped shelves represent different areas of science—from philosophy and astronomy at the base to neuroscience, nanoscience, and other areas on top. There are five main branches of science and many shelves span multiple branches, symbolizing interdisciplinary connections. As time progresses upwards, science grows in scope and activity. There is growth to the future and erosion to the past. Ideas serve as nutrients, spawning new outgrowths. Shelves differ in size, indicating the volume of scientific research in that area.\
\
Pathways tunnel through the sculpture so visitors can trace the evolution of scientific ideas back to their origins using marbles. Simply place a marble at the contemporary, top level and observe areas of science it travels through before it reaches the bottom. Since many sciences draw on more than one area of research, different runs will result in alternative marble trajectories. Some intellectual journeys are gentle, steady paths while others make for wild rides.\

The sculpture was displayed as part of \[RE]imagining Science, an exhibit at the Grunwald Gallery of Art at Indiana University that featured a number of artist/scientist collaborations.
