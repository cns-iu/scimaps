This comic book was designed by Geoff Hobart, a freelance cartoonist currently living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, in close collaboration with Katy Börner, Victor H. Yngve Professor of Information Science at the School of Library and Information Science at Indiana University in Bloomington, IN. Much of Börner’s commentary was taken from the Atlas of Science by MIT Press. Geena was inspired by Börner’s daughter Eleanor. We would like to thank Todd Theriault for editing the commentaries and Tracey Theriault for adding all the science maps and building the final layouts. The work was supported by the CreativeIT Program at the National Science Foundation under Grant No. IIS-0715303 and the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center at Indiana University. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.
