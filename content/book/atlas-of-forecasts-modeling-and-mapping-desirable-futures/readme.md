To envision and create the futures we want, society needs an appropriate understanding of the likely impact of alternative actions. Data models and visualizations offer a way to understand and intelligently manage complex, interlinked systems in science and technology, education, and policymaking. *Atlas of Forecasts*, from the creator of *Atlas of Science* and *Atlas of Knowledge*, shows how we can use data to predict, communicate, and ultimately attain desirable futures.\
\
Using advanced data visualizations to introduce different types of computational models, *Atlas of Forecasts* demonstrates how models can inform effective decision-making in education, science, technology, and policymaking. The models and maps presented aim to help anyone understand key processes and outcomes of complex systems dynamics, including which human skills are needed in an artificial intelligence-empowered economy; what progress in science and technology is likely to be made; and how policymakers can future-proof regions or nations. This Atlas offers a driver's seat-perspective for a test-drive of the future.

“*Atlas of Forecasts* is mind-boggling—parading the multiple dimensions of our future, and the rich set of tools and data that data science has assembled, so that we can grasp the destiny of the natural, social, and technological systems that surround us. Richly illustrated, colorful, and rigorous, this *Atlas* takes us on an eye-opening journey.”
