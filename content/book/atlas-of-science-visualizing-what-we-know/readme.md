title: "Atlas of Science: Visualizing What We Know"
author: Katy BÃ¶rner
publisher: MIT Press
abstract: "**Atlas of Science**, based on the popular exhibit *Places & Spaces:
  Mapping Science*, describes and displays successful mapping techniques. The
  heart of the book is a visual feast: Claudius Ptolemy's Cosmographia World Map
  from 1482; a guide to a PhD thesis that resembles a subway map; \"the
  structure of science\" as revealed in a map of citation relationships in
  papers published in 2002; a periodic table; and many more. Each entry includes
  the story behind the map and biographies of its makers."
