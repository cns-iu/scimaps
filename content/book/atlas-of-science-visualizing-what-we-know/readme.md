*Atlas of Science*, based on the popular exhibit *Places & Spaces: Mapping Science*, describes and displays successful mapping techniques. The heart of the book is a visual feast: Claudius Ptolemy's Cosmographia World Map from 1482; a guide to a PhD thesis that resembles a subway map; "the structure of science" as revealed in a map of citation relationships in papers published in 2002; a periodic table; and many more. Each entry includes the story behind the map and biographies of its makers.\
\
*“Science is a voyage of discovery and Katy Börner has provided its first atlas. This excellent book offers a compendium of all that is best in explaining visual maps of our scientific knowledge.”*\
—Michael Batty, University College London
