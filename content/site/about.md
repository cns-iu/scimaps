curatorsDescription: The *Places & Spaces* exhibit is curated by
  the [Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center](http://cns.iu.edu/) at
  Indiana University. CNS's mission is to advance datasets, tools, and services
  for the study of biomedical, social and behavioral science, physics, and other
  networks. A specific focus is research on the structure and evolution of
  science and technology (S&T) and the communication of results via static and
  interactive maps of science. The Center's administrative home is in Luddy Hall
  at the [School of Informatics, Computing, and
  Engineering](http://soic.iu.edu/), Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana,
  USA.
advisoryBoardDescription: The pieces that make up the *Places & Spaces* exhibit
  are chosen annually in a process that begins with a call for submissions.
  Then, the team of international reviewers and exhibit advisors shown below
  work with the Indiana University exhibit team to select the most insightful
  and innovative submissions. The Indiana University exhibit team benefits
  greatly from the expert input it receives from this international advisory
  board.
ambassadorsDescription: These men and women from around the globe work
  selflessly to make the exhibit a success. Their intellectual guidance and
  commitment to promoting science mapping are what has made *Places &
  Spaces* the vital exhibit it is today. Those whom are also members of
  the [Advisory Board](http://scimaps.org/advisory_board.html) not only work to
  build public awareness of the exhibit, but also participate in the map
  selection process.
