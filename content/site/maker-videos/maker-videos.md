description: Over the course of 10 years, the exhibit has featured the
  imaginative and inspiring work of more than 250 artists and mapmakers. A few
  of them have graciously agreed to take a few moments to discuss their work,
  how they got involved with the exhibit, and walk us through their creative
  processes.
