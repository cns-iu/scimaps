Make a valuable contribution to the rich intellectual life of your institution by purchasing this collection of 100 maps, which includes a number of historically significant “firsts” in science mapping. Maps can be purchased with or without accompanying documentation like the companion Atlas books, didactic panels from the exhibit, and the semi-documentary short film Humanexus which accompanies the exhibit. MARC records are available.
