      The *Places & Spaces: Envisioning Intelligences* exhibit aims to inspire discussion about intelligences by biological and technological life forms. It welcomes visualizations of linguistic, kinesthetic, communication, musical, emotional, and other intelligences with a focus on collaboration and coordination across life forms and intelligence types. The visualizations aim to surface strengths and weaknesses of existing and future sensors & actuators, memory & reasoning, exploration & communication, plus shared goals & desirable futures.


      Each year, submissions are reviewed by an international, interdisciplinary advisory board. Selected entries will be added to *Places & Spaces*, a traveling exhibit designed to open people’s minds and hearts to the value, complexity, and beauty of science and technology. The resulting collection will provide a glimpse into the future—a time when larger and more complex datasets are available, multi-factor analysis becomes commonplace, and human and machine intelligence merge in support of creative problem solving and positive societal impact. Show us your vision of this future by submitting your work to the 3rd decade of the exhibit.


      *Places & Spaces* currently features 100 maps from the 1st decade and 40 interactive macroscopes from the 2nd decade of the exhibit that cover data, code, and expertise from a wide range of disciplines. Since 2005, the exhibit has traveled to 30 countries and appeared in various formats at over 458 venues and events, including the Davos Economic Forum, National Academy of Sciences, and the New York Public Library. News coverage has appeared in *Nature*, *Science*, *USA Today*, and *Wired*.

      * Link to photo, video, or online site that features the work

      * Description of the work (300 words max) explaining how the visualization can help people understand intelligences better. If possible, provide details on target user groups and needs served, intelligences visualized, data used, data analysis performed, visualization techniques applied, and main insights gained. Also share information on the impact the work has had on public awareness, social policy, or political action.

      * References to relevant publications or online sites and links to related projects or works
