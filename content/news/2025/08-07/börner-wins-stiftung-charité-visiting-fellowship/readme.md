[Katy Börner](https://cns.iu.edu/current_team/bio/katy_borner.html), Victor H. Yngve Distinguished Professor of Engineering and Information Science and director of the [Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science (CNS) Center](https://cns.iu.edu/mission.html) at the [Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering,](https://luddy.indiana.edu/) has been named a [Stiftung Charité Visiting Fellow.](https://www.stiftung-charite.de/en/funding/research-funding/visiting-fellows)

The three-year fellowship, which began July 1, will support collaborations with [Berlin Institute of Health](https://www.bihealth.org/en/) Professor [Peter Robinson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-n-robinson-b7833811/) and further develop the [Human Reference Atlas](https://humanatlas.io/) (HRA), a three-dimensional atlas of all anatomical structures and cells of the healthy human body. See details in recent [Nature Methods paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02563-5).

Their project is titled, “Multiscale Human Reference Atlas – An Ontological Bridge Between Anatomy and Disease.” It interconnects the Börner-led Human Reference Atlas and the Robinson-led Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), which provides comprehensive bioinformatic resources for the analysis of human diseases and phenotypes to create a computational bridge between genome biology and clinical medicine.

Börner said the goal is to link the HRA to the HPO and medical data “in order to describe disease characteristics and improve diagnostics and research into rare and complex diseases.”
