Celebration began with sunlight streaming into Luddy Hall’s fourth floor. [Katy Börner](https://ils.indiana.edu/contact/profile/?profile_id=2), [Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering](https://luddy.indiana.edu/) Victor H. Yngve Professor of Engineering and Information Science and director of the [Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science (CNS) Center](https://cns.iu.edu/), embraced a seventh birthday like no other last Friday with fifty artists, researchers and supporters.

[Elizabeth Record](https://luddy.indiana.edu/contact/profile/index.html?Lisel_Record), associate director for the CNS Center, and [Nicole C Johnson,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-johnson-568aa990/) CNS Center assistant, along with Data Science master’s student [Meryl Sarah Jacob,](https://cns.iu.edu/current_team/bio/Meryl-Jacob.html) organized the event.

Looming above from the atrium ceiling, [Amatria](https://cns.iu.edu/amatria.html) worked science-as- sentient-architecture magic. Flashes of light, a rustle of movement and a sense of vast intelligence radiated from a luminous, forest-inspired landscape of soaring clouds and tangled thickets.
