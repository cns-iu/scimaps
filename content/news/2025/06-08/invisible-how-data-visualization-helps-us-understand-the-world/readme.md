Dresden researchers are showcasing the power of scientific visualizations in a new exhibition at the COSMO Science Forum. Until August 6 and under the mottoÂ **\[in]visible. The art of visualization in science**, COSMO invites visitors on an interactive exploration of the world of complex systems and scientific visualizations. It features both exhibits from current Dresden research and contributions from the international exhibition Places & Spaces: Mapping Science. The exhibition shows how science makes data visible - and why this is crucial for all of us: for research, everyday life and for our democracy.

The exhibition will be complemented with lectures, workshops and discussion panels.

**Why this exhibition is so highly relevant today**

Whether pandemics, climate crisis or election research - data shapes our everyday lives. Yet, it only becomes understandable through visualization. The exhibition at COSMO shows how data becomes images, what stories it tells, and how we can learn to read it. As those who understand visualizations can make more informed decisions, can better identify complex relationships, and as a result can recognize manipulation.
