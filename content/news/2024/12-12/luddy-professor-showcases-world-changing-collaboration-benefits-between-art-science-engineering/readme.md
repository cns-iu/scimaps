Collaborations between science, engineering and art can generate world-changing innovations, and stunning visual proof came during a recent presentation by [Katy Börner](https://luddy.indiana.edu/contact/profile/index.html?Katy_B%C3%B6rner),[Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering](https://luddy.indiana.edu/) Victor H. Yngve Professor of Engineering and Information Science, at Indiana University’s [Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Museum of Art.](https://artmuseum.indiana.edu/)

Artists, scientists, and data engineers gathered to view a collection of artworks, paired with their natural inspirations, that showcased multiple ways that art, science, and engineering can be motivated by an appreciation for biological processes and the beauty of the natural world across multiple scales.

The exhibits are currently displayed on the fourth floor of Luddy Hall.

“Collaborations across art, science, and engineering lead to innovations that are larger than the sum of parts,” Börner said. “That makes it possible to tackle the grand challenges we are facing so we all live desirable futures.”

Börner and her team at the [Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center](https://cns.iu.edu/) research, develop, and serve innovative methods and tools to model and visualize data from science, technology, biomedicine, education, and public policy.

That’s highlighted by their seven-year development of the [Human Reference Atlas](https://humanatlas.io/), a source of harmonized biological data designed to help biologists better understand health and disease, guide pharmacological development, and increase our understanding of how human bodies function.

Börner’s presentation featured impressive work such as *CeCe and Squiggy* by Todd N. Theriault, Melanie B. Goldstone and Shouvik Maiti; *Capillus Linus (Hair Line)* by Carrie Longley; *Tabula Floris* by Luke Nikolov; *Beauty is Everywhere* by Angela Caldwell; and *Molecular Galaxy* by Beata Edyta Mierzwa.

[Theriault](https://luddy.indiana.edu/contact/profile/index.html?Todd_Theriault) is a technical writer for the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center. [Maiti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shouvik-maiti/) is an IU Data Science student. Goldstone is a freelance UX designer based in Germany. [Longley](https://east.iu.edu/gallery/people.php) is an assistant professor of Fine Art at Indiana University East. [Nikolov](https://biology.indiana.edu/about/faculty/nikolov-luke.html) is an IU assistant professor of Biology. [Caldwell](https://eskenazi.indiana.edu/faculty/directory/caldwell-angela.html) is a visiting assistant professor of metalsmithing and jewelry design at IU. [Mierzwa](https://beatascienceart.com/about/) is a molecular biologist at the University of California San Diego and the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research.

Börner, whose research explores the frontiers of data visualization, said the presentation led to a fascinating discussion that “provided fertile ground for developing future collaborations.”
