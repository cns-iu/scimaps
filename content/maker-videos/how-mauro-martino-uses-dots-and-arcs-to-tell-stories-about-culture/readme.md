short_description: How Mauro Martino uses dots and arcs to tell stories about culture
long_description: Data visualization expert Mauro Martino walks us through
  Charting Culture (2014), an animation he co-created with Maximillian Schich.
  It is one of Natureâ€™s most popular videos. Martino explains how tracking where
  people are born and where they die can reveal migration patterns, show rising
  and falling fortunes of cultural centers, and reflect changes in
  transportation.
