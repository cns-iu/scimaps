long_description: "Sculptor Carrie Longleyâ€™s contribution to Places & Spaces is
  a work of touchable data that brings together the realms of scientific
  research and artistic expression. In this interview, she reveals why this
  project challenged her artistic process and explains how the tactile,
  three-dimensional quality of clay sculpture can convey facets of data that
  image and text cannot. "
