  up-close-and-personal view of science maps and the talented individuals that
  create them. Curators Katy Börner and Deborah MacPherson and mapmakers Kevin
  Boyack, Brad Paley, Dick Klavans, André Skupin, and Henry Small are on hand to
  share insights into the science visualizations, reveal how they are created,
  and discuss the power of mental maps to help us better understand the
  structure of science. "
