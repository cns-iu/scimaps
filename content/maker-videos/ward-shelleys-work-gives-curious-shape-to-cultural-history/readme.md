short_description: Ward Shelleyâ€™s work gives curious shape to cultural history
long_description: Artist Ward Shelley guides us through the twists and turns of
  his astonishing History of Science Fiction (2011) and reveals how he creates
  his biomorphic cultural narratives. Shelley discusses the role of the artist
  as storyteller, the different priorities of science and art, and the benefits
  of having a squid-shaped sense of time.
