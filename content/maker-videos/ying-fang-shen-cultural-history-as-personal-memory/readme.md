short_description: "Ying-Fang Shen: Cultural history as personal memory"
long_description: As part of a making-of featurette for the multi-award winning
  Humanexus (2013), artist Ying-Fang Shen explains her decision to present the
  history of human communication as a series of “memory pieces.” She discusses
  how filtering cultural history through individual recollection reveals its
  selective and subjective nature. The past then becomes both what we choose to
  remember and how we choose to remember it.
