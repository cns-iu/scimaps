_Places & Spaces_ at CDC Museum
===============================

January 25 - June 17, 2016
--------------------------

From January 25 to June 17, 2016, the David J. Sencer CDC Museum will feature the _Places & Spaces: Mapping Science_ exhibit, a collection of visualizations that tell stories compelling to both specialists and generalists alike. In keeping with its commitment to public health education and disease prevention, the CDC Museum has selected an exhibit that demonstrates the power of data visualization to confront many of society’s most significant challenges.

David J. Sencer CDC Museum

For over a decade, the _Places & Spaces_ exhibit has collected science maps and visualization tools from leading international experts in the natural, physical, and social sciences but also from industry and government. By helping audiences grasp the abstract concepts, relationships, and dynamism of complex systems, the exhibit promotes more informed, effective decision making on the part of private individuals, industry practitioners, public policymakers, and others.  
  
Dr. Robin Wagner, Chief Science Officer for the Office of Public Health Scientific Services, attests to science mapping’s capacity to aid comprehension and inspire action: “CDC uses maps to better understand patterns and relationships between environmental, social and personal risk factors, and diseases and injuries over time and space. Visualizations can make it easier for CDC to take faster, better actions to protect the public’s health. This is why the David J. Sencer CDC Museum, in partnership with the CDC Office of Public Health Scientific Services, is pleased to host _Places & Spaces: Mapping Science._”  
  
Two special events have been scheduled in conjunction with the exhibit’s residency. On February 4 from 5 to 6 p.m., _Places & Spaces_ curator Katy Börner will deliver the inaugural lecture, “Data Visualizations—Drawing Actionable Insights from Data.” Dr. Börner’s talk will be followed on February 5 by a scientific symposium entitled “Seeing for Action—Using Maps and Graphs to Protect the Public’s Health,” which will take place from 1:30-4:30 p.m. The symposium will provide an opportunity for researchers from government, industry, and academia to discuss the rich potential of visualization tools to communicate public health threats and lead to more efficient responses.  
  
Both events will be held on the CDC headquarters campus in Auditorium A, CDC Tom Harkin Global Communications Center (Building 19) 1600 Clifton Road, NE, Atlanta, GA 30329-4027. Please note that registration for these events is required. Non-U.S. citizens (including permanent residents) must register by January 4, 2016, to allow enough time for the CDC to process their security clearance. Registration forms may be found at [http://goo.g./forms/I6S59AqZrA](http://goo.g./forms/I6S59AqZrA). Additional questions regarding these events can be directed to Ms. Laura Mann at [kve7@cdc.gov](kve7@cdc.gov).
