Exhibit Archives
================

The following institutions have archived the _Places & Spaces: Mapping Science_ exhibit maps:

*   United States Library of Congress (G9930 2007 .B6)

Archival quality 24” x 30” (61cm x 77cm) prints of the exhibit maps can be purchased for inclusion in map libraries or special collections. Both paper and ink have been chosen with long-term preservation and stability in mind. Make a valuable contribution to the rich intellectual life of your institution by purchasing this collection of 100 maps, which includes a number of historically significant “firsts” in science mapping. Maps can be purchased with or without accompanying documentation like the companion _Atlas_ books, didactic panels from the exhibit, and the semi-documentary short film _Humanexus_ which accompanies the exhibit. MARC records are available.
