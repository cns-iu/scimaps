This iteration explores the utility of science maps as visual interfaces to digital libraries to support the selection, navigation, management, and usage of resources by communicating:

*   Early visions of a multimedia work station and the Internet.
*   A hand-drawn map of natural sciences and technology with overlays of different index and abstracting services.
*   A visualization of textual cross-references in the Bible.
*   Differences in the coverage and search functionality of four major publication databases and their impact on search result sets.
*   A comparison of Wikipedia's category structure and the Universal Decimal Classification.
*   Expert locations and worldwide scientific collaboration patterns.
*   The complete structure and interlinkage of different data types from a scholarly database to judge data quality and coverage.
*   An overview of key metadata standards in the cultural heritage sector to assist planners with the selection and implementation of these standards.
*   The hierarchical structure of over 2,800 terms for tagging digital resources in architecture in different languages.
*   The history of science fiction rendered as graphical chronology.
