Technical Specifications
========================

Museum quality maps are printed on premium luster paper in a size of 30 inches (76.2 cm) x 24 inches (60.96 cm) and mounted on foam core (see typical layout of a set of 10 maps below). Maps can be ordered online at [scimaps.org/store](http://scimaps.org/store).  
[![](images/hosting/technical_specs_sm.jpg)](images/hosting/technical_specs_lg.jpg) The _WorldProcessor Globes_ have a diameter of 12 inches (30.48 cm) and a height of 5 feet (1.53 m). This invites the ‘spinning’ of the globes by visitors (see below).  
  
The _Illuminated Diagram_ (ID) is comprised of two high-resolution prints on cling paper that is then attached to two LCD screens (see Figure 9 on page 7). **The LCD screens must be rented on-site**, and cling prints must be attached. A touch screen lectern allows a user to interact with the LCDs (see below). The LCDs and lectern are run by 3 Mac Minis (provided by us).  
  
The _Hands-on Science Maps for Kids_ should be displayed on a table. They are 18 inches (45.72 cm) tall, 12 inches (30.48 cm) deep and about 33 inches (83.82 cm) wide (see below).

Additionally, there are **didactic panels** (one per iteration) and **labels** for all elements of the exhibit. Map panels and labels are mounted on foam core. If needed, we can adapt the map labels to your venue (at an extra cost).
