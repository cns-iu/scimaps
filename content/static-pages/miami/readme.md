Places & Spaces at the University of Miami
==========================================

September 4 - December 11, 2014
-------------------------------

Are you interested in seeing science from above? Curious to see what impact one single person or invention can have? Keen to find pockets of innovation? Desperate for better tools to manage the information flood? Or are you simply fascinated by maps? Then plan to visit the _Places & Spaces: Mapping Science_ exhibit, which will be on display at the University of Miami from September 4 to December 11, 2014.

The exhibit aims to demonstrate the power of maps to navigate and make sense of physical places and abstract topic spaces. Scientists will be stimulated, students and teachers encouraged, and the general public fascinated by this multi-layered, accessible approach to the worlds of modern scientific thought.  
  
The Miami exhibit is particularly exciting as it marks the debut of the exhibit’s [10th iteration](/iteration/10/ "10th iteration")—and for the first time, all 100 maps are displayed together. These fascinating new maps explore the future of science mapping and continue the exhibit’s commitment to bringing audiences the most stunning and groundbreaking examples of data visualization from the most brilliant mapmakers of our time.  
  
Half of the 100 visualizations are displayed at the Stanley and Jewell Glasgow Hall in the [Perez Architecture Center](http://arc.miami.edu/the-school/facilities/perez-architecture-center). The other half, and all the 3D and interactive elements, are on the first and second floors of the [Otto G. Richter Library](http://library.miami.edu/). A series of seminars and other events are being held throughout the Fall semester all over campus. Check out the [University of Miami’s Visualization website](http://visualization.miami.edu/ps/) for details.
