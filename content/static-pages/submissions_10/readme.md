10th Iteration on “The Future of Science Mapping” (2014)
========================================================

**Submission Details**  
The 10th and final iteration of the exhibit is devoted to maps of science that point to the future of the practice itself. Micro to macro studies using quantitative and/or qualitative data are welcome, and mixed methods approaches are encouraged. Maps should be understandable by a general audience and might answer questions such as:

All map makers were invited to submit

*   Low-resolution version of map
*   Title of work
*   Author(s) name, email address, affiliation, mailing address
*   Copyright holder (if different from authors)
*   Description of work: learning objectives addressed, data used, data analysis, visualization techniques applied, and main insights gained (100-300 words)
*   References to publications or online sites in which the map appeared
*   Links to related projects/works
*   At least three keywords

We received **12** submissions and have identified another **14** existing maps we think would make great additions to the exhibit. The exhibit advisory board and the external experts are asked to judge all 24 maps and their descriptions in terms of:

*   _**Scientific value**_ â€“ quality of data collection, analysis and communication of results in support of clearly stated learning objectives. Appropriate and innovative application of existing algorithms and/or development of new approaches.
*   **_Value for decision making_** â€“ what major insight does the map provide and why does it matter? Is the map easy to understand by a general audience? Does it inspire viewers to learn more about science and technology?

Please rank the maps from **10 to 1** (10 being the best) according to scientific value and value for decision making. Download [this XLS file](/exhibit/docs/10th-Iteration-Judging-Sheet.xls) and put your rankings in the "rank" column. Please also supply ‘citable quotes’ for the top-three maps. The quotes should highlight the maps' major value. If you feel strongly that a particular map should **not** be included, mark an "X" next to it in the "Points" column. Send the completed XLS file with the three citable quotes to Todd Theriault ([ttheriau@indiana.edu](mailto:ttheriau@indiana.edu)) by **February 19th, 2014** in time for our meeting on February 20th, 2014.

### #1 - Visualization of Similar Usage of Scholarly Journals by Research Groups of Wageningen University and Research, the Netherlands

**Marco van Veller**  
Wageningen UR Library  
  
Network of 315 Wageningen UR research groups based upon a similarity analysis on shared use of journals in articles published by these groups in 2010, 2011 and 2012  
  
The network above visualizes similarity in journal citations by the 315 research groups of Wageningen UR based upon their published articles in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The size of the bubbles corresponds with the size of the article output in 2010, 2011 and 2012 for each group. Research groups that are placed closely together in the network have more similar usage of journals (measured by citations) in the reference lists of their published articles.  
  
With the software application VOSviewer (Van Eck & Waltman, 2011) a network is created from a cluster analysis on a similarity matrix, presenting co-citation of journals in journal articles of the 315 research groups. To correct for differences in group size and research output, citations per journal are fractionized to the total number of references in the published articles of each research group.  
From the network above it follows that the research groups can be clustered in five clusters, represented by the five different colours. In majority, the five clusters correspond with the five aggregations of research groups under which the research groups are organized at Wageningen UR:  
  

*   yellow: Plant Sciences group
*   green: Agrotechnology and Food Sciences group
*   purple: Animal Sciences group
*   red: Social Sciences group
*   blue: Environmental Sciences group

By creating networks from analysis of articles published in consecutive years it is possible to follow the similarity in journal usage by research groups over time. Emerging similar journals usage by research groups can be identified and used as information for collection management decisions by the library. Further, trends in the clustering of research groups in the networks over time can identify existing and potential collaborations for these groups.

**Reviewer Comments:**

"Didn't see anything new in either data use or insights."

"Just average in the knowledge it exposes and how it visualizes things."

"Lacks grand nature."

"Co-citation networks do not seem to represent a novel use of scientometrics. A time series over multiple years or animated would be more interesting."

### #2 - SCImago Net: SCImago Journal Rank Pool Map Interface

SCImago Net (Figure 1) is a browsable, zoomable and interactive tree map of the 20,544 journals of Scopus. This map is actually an interface that makes it possible to visualize and analyze the exchange of knowledge taking place among all the Scopus journals, at three levels. On the first level, the journals are shown grouped according to the subject area, based on their relations of neighborhood (Bederson, Shneiderman and Wattenberg, 2002). On this level, the attributes are chosen (bibliometric indicators and/or levels of links) that determine both the color of the nodes representing the linking journals, and the type and level of depth of analysis. On a second level (Figure 2), by zooming over any part of the map, the titles and rectangles that delimit the subject areas begin to disappear gradually; at the same time, the titles and borderlines that configure the categories where the zoom is focused begin to emerge gradually. Each category is made up of clusters of journals of that same category, grouped according to their centrality (Fruchterman and Reingold, 1991). Finally, on a third level (Figure 3), by continuing with the zoom in on a certain category or part of the map, the nodes of each journal gradually appear, together with the titles. By selecting a journal in light of the attributes of the links selected on the first level, one can view the inputs (citation), outputs (referencing) or both. That is, the overall interchange of knowledge that occurs among journals, categories and subject areas of the Scopus database becomes manifest. Another possibility is to use the analytical search of the first level, and let the interface itself locate the journal and display its interactions.  

**Reviewer Comments:**

"Beautiful! Data like a formal French garden."

"Initially, I gave this map a high rank because I liked the idea of visualizing and analyzing the exchange of knowledge taking place among all the Scopus journals. But the results depicted in Fig 3 didn't speak to me at all.Â We create too many smart measures that do not mean much."

"I like that it combines browsable, zoomable & interactive tree maps of the Scopus journal. It provides a view of useful analytics and is one of several that get at a knowledge frontier."

"Needs specific example explained."

"Great ifÂ  both zoomable and poster version can be shown in exhibit."

"This should be an interactive display rather than a flat map."

### #3 - Exploring the Relationships between a Map of Altruism and a Map of Science

**Richard Klavans**  
SciTech Strategies, Inc.  

**Kevin W. Boyack**  
SciTech Strategies, Inc.  
  
Description: Altruistic activities are considered a virtue in most cultures, and are comprised of the selfless giving of both time and money to promote noble causes. The scope of these activities is enormous; the revenue for U.S. non-profit organizations (NPOs) is six times larger than the national R&D investment ($2.7 trillion vs. $450 billion in 2011). This poster shows several relationships between the worlds of altruism and science using maps of the two spaces.  
  
A map of altruism was created using text from the websites of 125,000 NPOs. Topic modeling (MALLET) was run on nearly 4 million web pages, creating a model with 1000 topics. Of these, the 357 topics directly related to NPO missions were located in a 2D map using the DrL layout algorithm. The poster version of the map does not show these topics, but shows the locations of nearly 100,000 NPOs overlaid on the topic space. A map of science was created from 43 million Scopus documents using a two-step process. First, documents were grouped into 156,000 clusters using the VOS direct citation methodology. Second, a map of the clusters was created using DrL using textual similarity between clusters.  
  
Most people consider altruism and science to be unrelated. While it is true that most NPO revenues support day-to-day activities related to altruistic missions, a surprising amount is used to fund scientific research, particularly in topics related to innovation, environment, and medicine. In contrast, very little NPO revenue is used to fund research into areas on the left-hand side of the altruism map - the altruistic missions dealing with different aspects of childhood development. Funding of more research to increase our understanding of these areas and how improvements might be made could lead to revolutionary advances that parallel those made in technology and medicine in recent years.

**Reviewer Comments:**

"Tickles the fancy, with a highly imaginative presentation of the key interrelations between science and philanthropy**."**

"I learned something from this map; an interesting comparison."

"It's an interesting idea and interesting comparison. But where did the idea that non-profits present altruism while science doesn't come from? Obviously, needs a better analysis. Citizenship came out pretty loaded and connected to too many areas on the right."

"Not surprising that Klavans & Boyack provide both an innovative approach (clustering & layout) and an important frontier topic - altruism.Â  A sure candidate."

"Opens up another mapping front.Â  Topically innovative and good to know about.Â  Non-profit status is an implicit subsidy in that we allow these dollars to pass outside of taxable channels.Â Â  Demonstrates how the public good is being served.Â  Would like to see more about the altruism map with sub-topics, with only a small insert pointing out the connections to science (does not have to have the map real estate it does).Â  Would like to see examples of the constituent NPO's for each area.Â  Need more info as to how international is the data.Â  Is this U.S. centric?"

Useful if it can be optimized to better make the connection between altruism and science, which is hard to glean out visually.

Visit the interactive application: [http://excellencemapping.net](http://excellencemapping.net)  
  
**Description of the work:**  
The web application analyzes scientific performance of universities and research institutions across various subject areas and presents them in ranking lists and on custom tile-based maps. In the application, the effect of covariates â€” such as gross domestic product of a country where an institution is located and corruption perception index â€” is examined using multi-level regression models. A covariate-adjusted ranking and mapping of the institutions is presented with the covariates being held constant.  
  
The analysis is based on Scopus data from the SCImago Institutions Rankings ([http://www.scimagoir.com](http://www.scimagoir.com)). We process information for institutions with at least 500 articles, reviews and conference papers which are indexed in a Scopus subject category. Citation impact of these publications covers the period to mid-2013. Performance of the institutions is recorded using the following two indicators. The first one, best paper rate, indicates a proportion of publications from an institution belonging to 10% of the most cited publications in a certain subject area and publication year. The second indicator, best journal rate, is the ratio of papers that an institution published in the worldâ€™s most influential journals, which are ranked in a subject-based first quartile of the SCImago Journal Rank (SJR).

**Reviewer Comments:**

"Including covariants is interesting. However, many of them are per country--i.e. very coarse-grained. Also the description & sources of covariants are needed."

"Worth considering as a resubmit that fits the frontier theme better and promised to include an interactive and static version. This is somewhat of a one-dimensional analysis."

"Useful--poster version will need stories."

"The utility of this map is unclear. And while it is interesting to see which countries or regions are more significant, it would leave too many questions for the visitor."

**Remark:**  
We would love to exhibit the interactive version, but could also supply a poster version, e.g. showing small multiples of the maps for different research areas along with some statistics and explanatory texts.  
  
As you might note, this is a resubmission from last year, but, as we improved the application substantially, we would be very grateful about a re-evaluation.

Please visit: [http://clients.stefaner.eu/uberresearch/places-spaces](http://clients.stefaner.eu/uberresearch/places-spaces).  
  
**Description of work:**  
The distribution of science funding greatly affects the future of research. Visual funding portfolios allow us to understand and coordinate science funding in better ways.  
  
For this project, we automatically assigned RCDC categories to grants from 23 major funders active in 2012 and add them to the already categorized NIH grants.  
  
On this basis, we calculated an overview map that shows the overall distribution of funds for the 50 most used categories. In this map, the bubble size shows the grant amounts spent on the topics, while the placement and coloring indicates similarities in the distribution of funding organizations for that topic. In addition, the same mapping method is applied to the portfolios of different funding organizations, thus reavling their unique preferences, priorities, and gaps.  
  
**Remarks:**  
These maps present work in progress, but will later be published at [http://www.uberresearch.com](http://www.uberresearch.com).  
  
The final maps could be optimized for print (e.g. An overview map with 6-9 annotated funding portfolios) or exhibited in interactive form. As this project represents work in progress, we will have a deeper datasets utilizing several different classification schemas available by spring.

**Reviewer Comments:**

"Where the money goes does help tell the story."

"It didn't give any new insights. Maybe a different visualization paradigm is needed to make them more thought provoking and actionable."

"AÂ good frontier topic with useful knowledge and promises to improve the product."

"More detail is needed on data and layout."

"Very interesting way to compare how funding of science happens."

We performed full-text analysis of the PLoS series of journals 2009-2012 (about 50,000 scientific papers) in order to extract bibliographic references and their contexts. First, we identified the different sections in the papers (Introduction, Method, Result and Discussion), using a rule-based Java application for text processing. We found that the distribution of the references along the text progression remains stable for the different journals. Secondly, we extracted the verb occurrences in citation contexts using the Stanford POS-tagger. The data were used to generate the representation using the Circos tool. The map shows the internal organization of scientific papers through the specific verbs associated to citations appearing in the different sections. The allows us to build a linguistic ontology of citations.

**Reviewer Comments:**

"Verbs are very tricky; it's good to see them under a microscope."

"Good analysis and presentation. Infrastructure has the fewest references but is crucial for research."

"I admit liking this idea but we would need a better understanding of what to conclude from theÂ  analysis and the busy graphic. Is this just an approach or has it provided new insights?"  
  
"Linguistic and semantic analyses of scientific documents are the way of the future.  
Specific takeaways are needed."

"Breaks new ground. Big Picture view of science mechanics.Â Informative for novices and a lay public."

"Semantic analysis of papers represents a fresh approach to jourrnal analysis."

Superstars in science attract attention because they have an out-sized impact on knowledge creation and diffusion. Do they create networks in ways that are different from others? Do those who win the Nobel Prize act as highly attractive nodes in a collaborative network? These maps show that Nobel Prize winners in medicine & physiology have a network that is denser and which contain more â€œsmall worldsâ€ than a matched group. The social capital created by the laureates as measured in the networks may be the reason that their names are put forward when it is time to nominate outstanding scientists for the prestigious prize.

**Reviewer Comments:**

"Good question and interesting hypothesis."

"Interesting but thin graphics and modest conclusions."

"Interesting, but not stand-alone yet."

"Represents an interesting use of social capital theory."

We are studying the entrance of scientific evaluation practices and managerial tools into civil society organizations, observing the fundamental ways in which the assessment of performance is changing. Our maps visualize this process. Concretely, we analyze the recombination of scientific and managerial discourses with civic ideals. Our data are derived from the websites of 369 organizations that we identified as actively involved in the debate on how to assess social impact by analyzing web crawler data (content of pages and references). We established organizationsâ€™ position vis-Ã -vis the three discourses by examining to what percentage of the pages of these websites mention 219 scientific, managerial, or associational keywords. These data enable us to draw the linguistic topography of nonprofit performance evaluation. In a second step, we calculated the median discursive position and identified those organizations around it as interstitial organizations whose blending of discourses suggests they have become fluent in a creole language that combines science, management, and civil society. Using these four linguistic communities, we analyzed bi-directional web references between organizations within the same category as well as across organizations in different groups. These dyadic ties help us identify both integration within and connections between discursive communities. The five smaller maps illustrate our analytical steps, and the final largest map summarizes all the information.  
  
The visualizations are programmed as scalable vector graphics (SVG), which allows us to create an interactive version of the visualization on the World Wide Web, in addition to the current poster. Users will be able to generate different views in real time by selecting types of nodes, types of relations, clustering methods, and zoom level. The visualized analysis inform two papers that are currently being prepared for publication: an analysis of the role of interstitial organizations in the proto-institutionalization of nonprofit performance evaluation, and a methodological discussion on how visualization can foster understanding of complex macro phenomena.

**Reviewer Comments:**

"A fascinating and intriguingly-new view of aspects of knowledge management."

"Interesting - different dimensions of decision making, but way too complex."

"I like the bridge idea as a frontier of investigation and we do have abundent graphics. Perhaps we need a bit more explaining of the graphic and the dense links "through bi-directional weblinks, forming an integrated community."

"This map applies a metrics approach to the greater world both in subject and in form."

"Novel and interesting use of network analysis for multiple intersecting macrophenomena."

### #9 - Sculplexity: New Dimensions for Visualizations of Science

Our work enables students and researchers to investigate some of the mathematical models used in complex systems whose applications including biology, physiology, sociology, economics, finance, engineering, and geography. By doing this with 3D printing, our approach also taps into the widespread interest in additive manufacturing technology which â€œhas the potential to revolutionise the way we make almost everythingâ€ (Obama, 2013). As the method is so cheap, our work offer new opportunities for involvement and engagement with the public.  
  
In terms of accessibility, our work also addresses serious limitations with traditional maps and similar visualisations. Our â€œtactilisation" is a representation of science that can be felt and held and so of great use when explaining science to those with limited visual abilities.  
  
The model shown illustrates a modified Forest Fire model used to illustrate concepts of self-organised criticality common in complex systems such as earthquakes to city sizes. It enables new types of fractal shape in both time and space to be identified. Our work is the first time 3D printing has been used in this way. Our approach shows how to transform the evolution of a two-dimensional spatial model (a cellular automata) into a 3D model. We used an overlapping cuboid structure to represent the model followed by Laplace smoothing. We also identified the key issues to be addressed in any such an approach.  
  
Overall our work highlights the possibilities in the future for visualisation of science that only 3D printing can offer. The shapes we can produce can not be manufactured in any other way illustrating how 3D printing is not just about producing existing objects in a new way. Our approach pushed visualisation into new dimensions: the third dimension of 3D printing and the new â€œdimensionâ€ of touch rather than just vision.  

**Reviewer Comments:**

"This is a totally innovative approach to create real 3D maps by 3D printing."

"It is not clear what this form is really representing, but the possibilities of making complex data physical and tactile is very compelling."

"I think it's time we bring more sensory into the understanding of science. Tactilization brings a new dimension into visualization and makes it accessible to the visually impaired.Â Sensory deepens our understanding and knowledge."

"New frontier, but is it a map?"

"Fascinating and futuristic, but not publicly accessible."

"This technique is on the forefront of technological innovation and invites a new dimension in science mapping."

"3D printing is a technology that has a proven record in medical fields, architecture and beyond. A current trend by a number data visualizersÂ  finding ways to make data more tactile and dimensional will only grow as 3D printing becomes more refined. This "map" extends tthe ability for mathematical models to demonstrate complex living systems. ModelingÂ abstract information so that it can speak to all of our senses can impact the general public in more meaningful ways."

"Very interesting and novel use of 3D printing for modeling cellular automata. Could be an interesting addition to the exhibition in a more advanced state, or if a well annotated time series can be done."

### #10 - ORBIS II

[http://orbis.stanford.edu/v2](http://orbis.stanford.edu/v2)  
  
ORBIS was created to better understand movement in the Roman world. The model was created using a constrained set of roughly 700 sites from Pleiades, roads as described by the Barrington Atlas, rivers from modern courses, and sea routes that were created through simulation of Roman-era vessels using changing wind patterns at a monthly scale. The entire process is described in detail from a historical and technical level on the project site.  
  
A route-finding interface allows the reader to see the most efficient route from one historical site to another. These routes in aggregate can create a dynamic distance cartogram to see the shape of the world as a distortion of geography based on the cost (in time or money or distance) to reach each site in the network. These cartograms provide data that can be used to divide the Roman world into regions based on cost to reach sites from competing centers. Both routes and cartograms can be run with different priorities, different modes of travel, or constrained to particular pieces of the network.  
  
ORBIS leverages the d3.js library to provide mapping as well as cartograms. Voronoi polygons are used to transform the point-based site information into regions. Individual routes also provide the dynamic capacity to contrast expense, time and distance.  
  
ORBIS has been used to better understand the role of transportation in the integration of the Germany, the limits of Diocletianâ€™s conquest of the West, and other classical questions, with a list of research papers using the model available on the site. It has also been used in environmental systems models and in classrooms to explore general principles of geography, as well as for a wide variety of public, non-academic purposes, such as whether the adventures of Asterix made historical sense.

**Reviewer Comments:**

"Transportation and communication speeds and costs strongly impact who rules the world."

"Interesting: calculating routes with a multitude of factors. I wonder if we can use a similar approach to calculate health benefits and the cost of various interventions. The only problem I had with the map is that I didn't get any new insights from it."

"A solid pleasure and good exposition of a topic of interest, but then I am a fan of Elijah Meeks."

"Well-done, but not broadly interesting."

"This map demonstrates the leaps in understanding that are possible, for the academic and the layperson alike, when mapping brings interdisciplinary information together in a new way."

"Could be applied to modern travel as well.Â  Not all places are equally accessible.Â  Warps a known substrate with important information variables.Â  A good example of the genre.Â Â  Would like to see the substrate actually warped to be equidistant by variable from Rome instead of color overlays."

"Network analysis of geospatial maps is an interesting and concrete application for visitors. Would have to simplify the terminology."

### #11 - Visualizing R&D Topical Concentrations through Science and Patent Overlay Maps

We present novel approaches to visually locate bodies of research within the sciences and areas of technology development within the innovation landscape. These combine the development of base maps and overlays to help benchmark individual organizations or entire science or technological fields. Combined, these approaches help understand how science and technology interact in specific research and development (R&D) applications. We illustrate the use of maps to understand R&D in nano-enabled drug delivery (NEDD) systems. Our science maps draw on data harvested from the CD-Rom version of the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) of the Science Citation Index (SCI) and the Social Science Citations Index (SSCI) of 2007, containing 221 Subject Categories (SCs). This data is used to generate a matrix of citing SCs to cited SCs with a total of 60,947,519 instances of citations between SCs. Our global patent maps are based on similarities in citing-to-cited relationships for IPCs of European Patent Office (EPO) patents from 2000 to 2006. This patent dataset, extracted from the Patstat database, represents more than 760,000 patent records in more than 400 IPC categories. A key insight is that IPC similarity, based on co-citation (and thus close in the global patent map) does not equate to being in the same hierarchical IPC branch, thus revealing new relationships among technologies. Here we show both science and patent overlay maps on an emerging technology â€“ Nano-Enabled Drug Delivery (NEDD) â€“ to illustrate their complementary information. Considering these together opens new potential for gaining perspective on R&D thrusts and relationships between publications and patents.

**Reviewer Comments:**

"Clear and accessible to a general public, the design offers the viewer a comprehensive overview of key elements in the patents/science issue."

"This map combines in a novel way information from science citation and patent data bases."

"This map does help understanding of how a domain is formed, and where it might be going."

"Good question, data sources, and analytics. The weakness is that it is not very actionable. I wonder if supplementing a map like this with aÂ more decision focused visualization can make it stronger."

"Fits our theme and is well presented."

"Add a conclusion about NEDD to the poster."

"A resultant I had long thought to be true is graphically proven in this map."Â 

"The linking of science and technology through patent overlay is interesting. Might need some additional explanation or examples for the visitor."

### #12 - Female to Male Productivity Ratio by Discipline: A UCSD Map Overlay

**Chaoqun Ni**

**Cassidy R. Sugimoto**  
Indiana University Bloomington

**Vincent LariviÃ¨re**  
University of Montreal  
  
This overlay map is an overlay of the UCSD map produced by BÃ¶rner and colleagues (2012). This map presents a disciplinary scientometric analysis of the relationship between gender and research output, as measured by the number of publication. We analyzed 5,483,841 research papers and review articles published between 2008-2012 in journals indexed in Web of Science by Thomson Reuters.  
  
The proportion of scholarly output of female and male was also examined at the level of the 554 UCSD Map of Science subject categories, which was approximated as a discipline/specialty in this project. Like in the world map, these ratios were compiled based on fractionalized authorship, but these gendered fractions of were then aggregated at the levels of specialties. The difference between the research output of male and female, therefore, was calculated by dividing the sum of fractionalized authorships of women to that of men for each discipline. The research output by disciplinary results confirmed previous findings and anecdotal knowledge about fields associated with 'care'. Specialties dominated by women include nursing; midwifery; speech, language and hearing; education; social work and librarianship. Male-dominated disciplines include military sciences, engineering, robotics, aeronautics and astronautics, high-energy physics, mathematics, computer science, philosophy and economics. Although disciplines from the social sciences show a larger proportion of female authors, the humanities are still heavily dominated by men. To visually display the difference by discipline, the UCSD map of science was utilized as the base map and the difference in research output of each gender in each discipline was overlaid on top of the base map, using D3 javascript library. Each discipline (a node at the map) was coloured based on the value of difference: the bluer a node is, the more active males are in the corresponding discipline; the more orange a node is, the more active females are in the corresponding discipline.

**Reviewer Comments:**

"Good question. Obviously cannot be answered via publications. Needs extra dimension of understanding and evolution in time."

"Good, but just incrementally one dimensional.Â Still it fills a gap."

"Poster should include the geo-map as well."

"Displaying gender differences in the sciences is a powerful topic - this map packs a punch in its ability to make the invisible visible and undeniable. Visualizations like this one could strongly influence future science by producing much needed change."

"A very concrete application of science map for studying an important problem. The reference system and color index is hard to read and it is unclear why there are so many more values for the females than males."

### #13 - Map of the Internet

**Martin Vargic**  
  
The map is divided into 2 distinctive parts; the eastern continent, â€˜the old worldâ€™ showcases software companies, gaming companies and some of the more real-life oriented websites. The western part, â€˜the new worldâ€™ is composed from two major continents, with the northern one showcasing social networks, search websites, video websites, blogs, forums and art websites.  
  
All major adult-oriented websites, in addition to various warez and torrent sites, are located on the southwestern continent of the map.  
  
In the very south of the map, there is located a â€˜Great Southern Landâ€™ of obsolete websites and online services. Outside the main map, there are also 4 mini maps showing NSA monitoring by country, most used browser, most used social network, and internet penetration by country.  
  
The scale between a websiteâ€™s traffic and its size is not exact, but websites are generally portrayed in ratio relative to it.  

**Reviewer Comments:**

"I liked this map so much I bought it."

"This is a very interesting visual metaphor.Â  For people who don't use computers or have a limited access to internet, it's almost imposible to explain the experience. Visualizing our virtual world enables one to identify the main concepts, the main players and the relationships among them. Because it evolves quickly, any type of more formal (e.g. object-entity-relational) diagram won't do the job here. The fact that it looks similar to the old geographical maps makes it easy to start a conversation as we know it's not perfect, not even scientific, but somehow it does represent our current view of this world."

"A bit dated, but might get in as a topical interest."

"Stunning, complete, highly informative."

"Connecting an old world map view with the newest world of the internet is a challeneging and visually appealing exercise.Â  Linking the connections to create a new Gondowlaland is statisitically back and fun."

### #14 - College Land

**Stephen Kobourov**  
University of Arizona  
  
This map shows connections and grouping of the top US Universities based on data from the 2008 "Fiske-Guide to Colleges". The authors of the book conducted a survey of the top colleges, asking them to provide names of other colleges "similar to" or "overlapping with" them. In our visualization, colleges are cities in the map. Links are drawn between pairs of similar colleges, and the distance between a pair of colleges on the map corresponds to the strength of the similarity. The countries in the map are formed by closely connected groups of colleges. The numbers below a college name are SAT ranges of students accepted. One of the surprise discoveries on the map is Franklin Olin College, with one of the highest SAT ranges (1440-1590), located in the West Coast cluster (with Caltech, Berkeley and UCLA).

**Reviewer Comments:**

"Students at Bloomington High School North are using this map to strategize where their parents will spend college money."

"Visualization of information books & guides is promising. Apart from SAT scores, this particular one didn't provide any clear insights that would guide a decision in choosing a school."

"Cute but perhaps two one dimesional."

"This map speaks to digital natives (high school students) in their own language."

### #15 - Being a Map of Physics (1939)

**Bernard H. Porter**  
  
Containing a brief historical outline of the subject as will be of interest to physicists, students, and laymen at large. Also giving description of the land of physics as seen by the daring souls who venture there and more particularly the location of villages (named after pioneer physicists) as found by the many rivers. Also the date of founding of each village. As well as the date of its extinction and finally collection of various and sundry symbols frequently met with on the trip.  
  
Perhaps, by representing physics as a continent and its main branches as rivers, it would have made that vast, mysterious subject more graspable to a mind more attuned to geography. And maybe, by populating its districts with villages named after famous physicists, the relation between those pioneers and their field of expertise would have been easier to memorize.  
  
Those fields are, left to right and top to bottom: Mechanics, Sound, Electricity, Magnetism, Light, Astronomy, Heat, Mechanical and Electromagnetic Energy, and Radioactivity.  
  
The map is more than a random representation of the different fields of physics: by displaying them as topographical elements of the same map, it hints at the unified nature of the subject. â€œJust like two rivers flow together, some of the largest advances in physics came when people realized that two subjects were \[like\] two sides of the same coinâ€, writes Jelmer Renema, who sent in this map.

**Reviewer Comments:**

"A great example of how a map can provide an introductory overview."

"Very physical map of physics, complete with pioneer villages."

"Representing our knowledge in a unified way is much needed. I thought a 3D+ would be useful here."

" Comments on the Map of Internet also apply here. I rank it in hopes that the exhibit will motivate the development of interactive maps of this kind."

"A bit dated too, but it is of a kind and has topical interest."

"I love maps like this."

### #16 - Cycles of Financial Crises 1810 to 2010

**Larry Gromley**  
HistoryShots  
  
**Bill Younker**  
HistoryShots  
  
This graphic is based on the New York Times and Wall Street Journal best seller _This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly_ by Carmen M. Reinhart & Kenneth S. Rogoff. Using data developed by Reinhart and Rogoff, it maps the cyclical history of financial crisis from 1810 to 2010 for sixty-six countries representing 90% of world GDP.  
  
_"Throughout history, rich and poor countries alike have been lending, borrowing, crashing -- and recovering -- their way through an extraordinary range of financial crises. Each time, the experts have chimed, 'this time is different', claiming that the old rules of valuation no longer apply and that the new situation bears little similarity to past disasters."_  
  
The giant wave in the top section of the graphic depicts the percentage of world GDP by region in crisis during the 200 year period. It includes the four major financial crisis types (sovereign default, banking, currency, and inflation) along with stock market crashes.  
  
The bottom section provides a detailed chart of all sovereign defaults by country, region and year. It shows the repeating nature of sovereign default, a central theme of Reinhart and Rogoff's book.  
  
Created in partnership with the Princeton University Press, this graphic provides a comprehensive yet accessible view into the historical and current cycles of financial crises.

**Reviewer Comments:**

"It is a great idea to visualize books that contain a lot of data (especially best-selling!). This is a great example where a picture is worth a thousand words."

"Covers an important topic and does it well to show how infographics can inform."

"Beautiful infographic, but not focused to call."

### #17 - CNN.com

**Nicholas Felton**  
  
In conjunction with the relaunch of their website, CNN asked me to examine their web statistics and create a visual record of the site's last 13 years. We were both interested in telling a larger story about the growth of the Internet and the change in peopleâ€™s media habits during this time through the lens of such an influential and heavily trafficked site.  
  
The process started by determining what metrics might hold an interesting narrative, and which ones were available over the entire lifespan of the site. CNN was able to provide me with daily page views, the top 20 days for every year and the most popular pages on those days. I was also provided with monthly category views and lists of the nations visiting the site.  
  
The spike chart of average weekly page views forms the centerpiece of the chart. The busiest 10 weeks are called out, and the events associated with the week are highlighted below the x-axis along with other events of cultural significance or large week-over-week gains. I also tracked the absolute and relative growth of their site categories over time, and highlighted several unique metrics at the top of the chart, including the busiest and slowest days of the year, and the number of countries that visit the site (192 at last count). Finally, to put everything in context, I found milestones in the history of the Internet for each year which I placed along the bottom of the chart to create context for the narrative.  
  
Ultimately, I think the most fascinating story here is the change in our news habits after September 11, 2001. After this day, a new and higher baseline for visits to the site is established, and the inference is that this event really established CNN.com and the Internet as a reliable, timely and indispensable source for news.  

**Reviewer Comments:**

"This visualization gives some insights on our human values and how our attention is driven by the media."

"Topical, too, so which of these do we chose?Â Better data analytic display than the maps."

"Infographic, not frontier."

### #18 - Graphical Description of Periods and Phases of the Renaissance Style in France During 1475-1895

This unique timeline from an handbook of architecture (1898) plots different styles and periods of renaissance style over 500 years. Time runs from left to right, from 1400 to 1900. The horizontal band on top shows major names and periods of the â€œFreiere Richtung,â€ i.e., free direction. The middle band features different styles and schools and works of the â€œStiel Entwicklung,â€ i.e., style development (see legend in lower right for a description of letters and numbers used). The lower band describes the â€œStrengere Richtungâ€, i.e., strict directionâ€”major names and time frames are shown as well as their influence on each other. The map is unique in the visual language used to show the â€œshapeâ€ and â€œimpactâ€ of styles, persons, and geographic places on each otherâ€”rendered as an organically evolving complex system.  
  
**Reviewer Comments:**

"Illustrates flow very well."

"This map is amazing in the variety of data, but its complexity is a bit overwhelming."

"Too remote, but a wonderful graphic."

"Beautiful, but not as compelling as Physics map--only need one of the two?"

By bringing together all types of information about species distributions, providing model-based integration, and providing a system for users to build upon our knowledge, the Map of Life project hopes to support our community in understanding and saving the world's biodiversity.  
  
The website will eventually show the current location of every known plant and animal species while also tracking any change to those populations and habitats due to climate change or other events. A demo version of the website just launched with information on 25,000 species, but tens of thousands more will be added.

**Reviewer Comments:**

"A noble cause, but what does it mean all possible types of information?"

"Too simple but is another candidate for topical inclusion to round out the set."

"Too much work needed to make a compelling poster."

### #20 - Flight Radar 24

  
Flightradar24 is the internationally acclaimed flight tracker service that is available both on the web, in your smartphone and in your tablet. With lots of useful and cool features, you're be able to monitor every move of the aircrafts in the sky above you.  
  
The technology we use to receive flight information from aircraft is called ADS-B. Roughly 60% of all passenger aircraft around the world are equipped with an ADS-B transponder. However, this percentage will continue to grow. Read more about the technology behind Flightradar24.  
  
The majority of the data displayed on Flightradar24.com and in our apps is gathered through a network of 500+ ADS-B receivers around the world. To improve our service we are always looking for people willing to contribute data to us. [Click here](http://www.flightradar24.com/increase-coverage) to find out how you can help us increase Flightradar24's global coverage.  
  
In addition to ADS-B data, we also display data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This data provides full coverage of the airspace above the United States and Canada. However, this data is slightly delayed (up to 5 minutes) due to FAA regulations. Because of this delay, the planes generated from FAA data are of a different color (orange) than the planes generated from real-time data (yellow).  
  
Flightradar24 started as a hobby project in 2006 when two Swedish aviation geeks decided to build a network of ADS-B receivers in Northern and Central Europe. In 2009 we opened up the network, and made it possible for anyone with an ADS-B receiver to upload data to the network. Many parts of the world were quickly covered, but the quest to provide global ADS-B coverage is still ongoing.

**Reviewer Comments:**

"Amazing data gathering and integration effort. However, this data is quite simple and possibly standardized."

"Not interesting to me."

"Extremely cool, but probably doesn't fit here."

"This Flight Radar visualization shows theÂ versatility of technologies (on computers and mobile devices) that display realtime data and use a combination ofÂ  receiver network data and crowdsourced data. It demonstrates the move to mobility with an app version that is easy to use and easy to contribute to (i.e., pointing your iPhone or iPad to the sky)."

**Randall Munroe**  
[xkcd.com](http://xkcd.com)  
  
This is the poster version of [comic #980](http://xkcd.com/980/), which is a guide to money. It started as a project to understand taxes and government spending, and turned into a rather extensive research project. With upwards of 200 sources and 150,000 tiny boxes, it's best appreciated in poster form. The 36"x24" high-quality poster print allows you to stand back and, all at once, take in the entire world economy.  
  
If you want an even bigger version, you can also buy the extra large 72"x48" version. This version provides a six-foot-wide mural view of the chart, allowing you to clearly read even the finest details.

**Reviewer Comments:**

"This map brings together information from multiple sources, easy to understand, high value for economic and political education."

"This is the most thought provoking visualization, that calls for actions and creates accountability. It puts in perspective and challenges our understanding of where the money is and is spent. Biomedical and other scientific research needs to be analysed in a similar way. What are the investments and the outcomes of different research areas? What is the balance between funding wellness and genetic research? Etc. The great sense of humor of the map creators provokes re-evaluation of the reality and our linear logical thinking."

"Provides wonderful detail and insight.Â  A good conversation piece."

"Not really science; makes one feel kind of small."

### #22 - PREDICT Health Map

In order to predict, respond to, and prevent the emergence of novel infectious diseases in humans, pathogens must be identified at their source. The PREDICT project, led by Principal Investigator and Co-Director Dr. Jonna A.K. Mazet, DVM, MVPM, PhD of the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine and Co-Director Stephen S. Morse, PhD of the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, recognizes that explosive human population growth and environmental changes have resulted in increased numbers of people living in close contact with animals. Unfortunately the resulting increase in contact, together with changes in land use, has altered the inherent ecological balance between pathogens and their human and animal hosts.  
  
PREDICT, a project of USAID's Emerging Pandemic Threats Program, is building a global early warning system to detect and reduce the impacts of emerging diseases that move between wildlife and people (zoonotic diseases). PREDICT has developed a SMART surveillance method (Strategic, Measurable, Adaptive, Responsive, and Targeted) that accounts for the fact that zoonotic pathogens, such as influenza and SARS, are responsible for the majority of emerging infectious diseases in people, and that more than three quarters of these emerging zoonoses are of wildlife origin. The SMART surveillance approach is designed to detect novel diseases with pandemic potential early, giving health professionals the best opportunity to prevent emergence and spread. It also targets sentinel animal species at active human interfaces in hotspot regions to improve surveillance efficiency.  
  
The PREDICT team builds on a broad coalition of partners to develop the global capacity to monitor diseases at the animal-human interface and develop a risk-based approach to concentrate these efforts in surveillance, prevention, and response at the most critical points for disease emergence from wildlife.  
  
PREDICT project objectives:

*   Assess local surveillance capacity;
*   Implement targeted and adaptive wildlife disease surveillance systems;
*   Develop and deliver new technologies to improve efforts close to the source;
*   Use cutting-edge information management and communication tools to bring the world closer to realizing an integrated, global approach to emerging zoonotic diseases.

**Reviewer Comments:**

"This interactive map provides an early warning system for emerging infectious diseases (zoonoses), based on a novel surveillance method with many partners. It can be used to predict and prevent or respond to disease outbreaks. Users can track the evolution of the situation on a global basis."  
Â   
"Very interestingÂ  project. It would be interesting to assess its impact. I do not rank it highly because there is no explanation of coverage--i.e., do they have data about all areas shown on the map? Or some areas don't have data and thus appear green?"

"Still a valuable contribution and shows some of the monitoring frontier that will grow in importance."

  
"Compelling idea, not compelling graphic."

**The navigation system for the future**  
  
Who gets the rare earths from China? What do the neo-Nazis in Europe? What are the consequences of land grab in Africa? How the drug war changed the countries of Central America? Answers to these and other major issues of the future are the new Atlas of globalization.  
  
The fourth major Atlas of globalization of Le Monde diplomatique into five chapters by the world of tomorrow. Topics include China's rise to world export champion, the new route through the pack ice, the fight for the right agriculture, the online universe, Japan to Fukushima, the year of the Arab Spring and the calculation of the Happy Planet Index.  
  
Still the best political guide through the world!  
  
This map shows the increasing inequality in the international trade of goods and services. The open markets are mainly used by transnational companies which have developed their very own economics. Data from the year 2000 on left, is contrasted with data from 2010, on right for the top 100 countries. 75 other countries with a total of less than one percent of total trade are not shown. Horizontal bar graphs are used to show the percent of volume in global trade of the top-100 countries. A world map depicts worldwide trade in billions of U.S. dollars together with major trade links, see legend. Pie charts display trade within the region in green and trade with other regions in blue. In these 11 years, China/Hongkong move from rank three to rank 2010.

**Reviewer Comments:**

"Seems a bit politically charged; drives your thinking instead of feeding it."

"Topical, too, so which of these do we chose?Â Not the most interesting data analytic display."

"Fascinating, but hard to see what to do with it."

The Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is keeping a running tally of the deaths and destruction caused by the earthquake and tsunami. While the tally is not yet complete, it already shows a stretch of devastation that reaches more than 400 miles along the coast. The count of total dead and missing is provided by the National Police Agency of Japan.

**Reviewer Comments:**

"Beautiful visualization."

"One dimensional but eye grabbing."Â 

"Too much work needed to make a compelling poster."

"The time and physical effect on this map is very persuasive and telling. Excellent use of time and motion in a static view."Â 

"This Tsunami map represents dynamic information vividly. It is very useful for the general public and scientists alike. It also portends the way that maps can show time and impact in extreme geological and weather systems."

"This is just a breathtaking map and familiar, but might be too tangential to the central theme of the exhibition."

### #25 - The Risk Interconnection Map 2013

**World Economic Forum**  
  
Finally, the survey asked respondents to choose pairs of risks which they think are strongly interconnected.xlix They were asked to pick a minimum of three and maximum of ten such connections.  
  
Putting together all chosen paired connections from all respondents leads to the network diagram presented in Figure 37 â€“ the Risk Interconnection Map. The diagram is constructed so that more connected risks are closer to the centre, while weakly connected risks are further out. The strength of the line depends on how many people had selected that particular combination.  
  
529 different connections were identified by survey respondents out of the theoretical maximum of 1,225 combinations possible.  
  
It is also interesting to see which are the most connected risks and where the five centres of gravity are located in the network (see Figure 40).

**Reviewer Comments:**

"This map could be used for many purposes, I can even imagine programming it into decision making software."

"Risk interconnectivity is an interesting exploration. It is easier to understand with the additional visualizations in the report."

"One dimensional but of a type."Â 

"Interesting subject, but simple network."

"A compelling way to show the relationship between cultural behaviors and social consequences."
