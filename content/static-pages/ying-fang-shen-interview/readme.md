Ying-Fang Shen: Cultural history as personal memory
---------------------------------------------------

As part of a making-of featurette for the multi-award winning _Humanexus_ (2013), artist Ying-Fang Shen explains her decision to present the history of human communication as a series of “memory pieces.” She discusses how filtering cultural history through individual recollection reveals its selective and subjective nature. The past then becomes both _what_ we choose to remember and how we choose to remember it.
