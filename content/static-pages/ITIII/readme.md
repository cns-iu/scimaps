The third iteration compares and contrasts maps of seismic hazards, resource depletion, economic models, and epidemic forecasts with maps forecasting the structure and evolution of science.  
  
Real-time weather forecasts are served by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Computational models of the movements of tectonic plates help reduce losses due to earthquakes, volcanic activity, or tsunamis. Economic models let us simulate either catastrophic or sustainable futures for humanity. Epidemic models allow us to understand how interconnected we all are and how actions far away affect us right here.  
  
Daily science and technology forecasts would show science maps with overlays of top experts, institutions, countries, major activity bursts, or emerging research frontiers augmenting our knowledge and decision-making capabilities. Given the importance of such forecasts, one might question why they are not available on TV, in the press, or online.
