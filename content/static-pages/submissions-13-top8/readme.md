### Abstract:

“Histography" is interactive timeline that spans across 14 billion years of history, from the Big Bang to 2015. The site draws historical events from Wikipedia and self-updates daily with new recorded events.

The interface allows for users to view between decades to millions of years.

The viewer can choose to watch a variety of events which have happened in a particular period or to target a specific event in time. For example you can look at the past century within the categories of war and inventions.

PitchSpace: Visualizing Startup Similarity using Bicentric Diagrams
===================================================================

### Abstract:

Startups are considered key innovation engines of modern economies. Founded by visionary entrepreneurs, startups often create novel product and service offerings which can disrupt entire markets and industries. Startups portray a unique type of dynamism, youth, and hipness, to which people of all ages are drawn. Contemporary examples are plentiful. Even Hollywood seems to have caught the startup bug.

While startups of the past may have primarily been a Silicon Valley only matter, today’s entrepreneurial landscape is truly global. Moreover, the speed at which startups emerge and evolve is mind boggling. Given this dynamism and complexity, understanding startups and their ecosystem can be challenging.

While prior work has frequently focused on the demographic and geographic characteristics of startup ventures, few studies have explored how a startup positions itself in an entrepreneurial ecosystem. In our work, we posit that the “pitch” -- the textual description used to describe the firm, its value propositions, vision, and markets -- is an incredibly valuable source of information that has not been studied systematically. Entrepreneurs often pitches to gain funding, market themselves, and connect with other stakeholders. So how similar (or different) are these pitches between startups? What insights can we gain when comparing pitches of two startups? Are there sectoral differences?

We identify, extract, and mine publicly-available and socially curated data on 76,153 startups from 191 geographical defined entrepreneurial regions to create a pairwise similarity measure of startup business descriptions. We then visualize this data using a bicentric diagram approach -- a novel graph-based set visualization technique that enables simultaneous identification of sets, set relationships, and set member reach in integrated egonetworks of two focal entities. Our resulting macroscope -- called PitchSpace -- allows individuals to browse different entrepreneurial regions (currently the top 5) and compare the similarity of startup pitches.

Visualizing Scholarly Influence Over Time
=========================================

![](images/submissions/13/scholarly-influence.jpg)

### Website(s):

### Author(s):

[Jason Portenoy](http://jasport.org) and [Jevin West](http://jasport.org)

### Abstract:

Assessing the influence of a scholar's work is an important task for funding organizations, academic departments, and researchers. Common methods, such as measures of citation counts, can ignore much of the nuance and multidimensionality of scholarly influence. We present an approach for generating dynamic visualizations of scholars' careers. This approach uses an animated node-link diagram showing the citation network accumulated around the researcher over the course of the career in concert with key indicators, highlighting influence both within and across fields. The center node in this visualization represents the entire body of work authored by a researcher, and nodes that appear around the center represent important papers that have cited those papers. These surrounding nodes are placed in a spiral around the center, ordered by publication date so that radial distance indicates time. The nodes' size indicates the influence of that paper (ranked by Eigenfactor score \[2\]), and color corresponds to field/category designations.

We applied the design to the Microsoft Academic Graph, an open data set which includes more than 120 million publications and 500 million citations. We provide an online application which allows a user to search for and manage collections of papers representing an author (or another concept, such as a department or organization) in order to generate these influence visualizations. We also provide a timeline visualization of the papers in the collection, allowing the user to highlight and drill down into the influence of specific papers. We have used these methods to explore the influence of the Pew Biomedical Scholars, a nonprofit funding organization, on the occasion of their 30th anniversary (see \[1\] for insights gained).

The Megaregions of the United States

### Abstract:

This Macroscope visualizes a new regional geography of the United States based on commuter patterns. Hundreds of millions of commuters weave 4 million threads connecting the approximately 70,000 Census tracts of the contiguous United States. These threads provide evidence for a new functional geography of the continent—based not on state or city lines, but on megaregions of vast areas connected by deep economic ties. By subjecting these connections to an algorithm which detects natural groupings in large data sets, we can define a mosaic structure of regions which cut interestingly across our familiar map of the country. Looking at the US in this new way helps us to reorient ourselves in terms of the ways that people are spatially connected in the twenty-first century.

ESA Star Mapper

### Website(s):

### Author(s):

### Abstract:

The ESA Star Mapper visualisation is an exploration of some central aspects of astrometric star catalogues, using data from ESA's Hipparcos mission.

The ESA Star Mapper visualisation shows 59 921 stars from the Hipparcos Catalogue. This subset of the entire catalogue was selected as follows: we include stars with the best parallaxes – the criterion is parallax/parallax error > 5. Parallaxes give a measure of the distance to these stars; we do not include stars that have no catalogue record of the magnitude or colour information; we include all stars from the constellations, even if their parallax values do not satisfy the criterion above. For those stars we assign an artificial parallax value of 1 mas. In practice, this is needed only for one of the stars in Orion's belt (Alnilam); for the 27 435 stars for which there is no radial velocity measurement from the XHIP catalogue, a random value between -30 and 30 kilometres per second.

### Abstract:

How does impact change over a scientific career?

Does impact, arguably the most relevant performance measure, follow predictable patterns?

Can we predict the timing of a scientist’s outstanding achievement?

Driven by these questions, we studied the evolution of productivity and impact throughout thousands of scientific careers. We reconstructed the publication record of scientists from seven disciplines, connecting each paper with its long-term impact on the scientific community as quantified by citation metrics. We found that the highest-impact work in a scientist’s career is randomly distributed within her body of work. That is, the highest-impact work has the same probability of falling anywhere in the sequence of papers published by a scientist. It could be the first publication, appear mid-career, or emerge last. This result is known as the random impact rule.

In this visualization, we show the random impact rule in all its power. You can explore careers in different disciplines, rank scientists according to different career parameters, or select a subset of them. You will always find the impact peaks occurring all over the place, from the beginning of a career on the left to the end of a career on the right.

The Network Behind the Cosmic Web

### Abstract:

The concept of the cosmic web—viewing the universe as a set of discrete galaxies held together by gravity—is deeply ingrained in cosmology. Yet, little is known about architecture of this network or its characteristics. Our research used data from 24,000 galaxies to construct multiple models of the cosmic web, offering complex blueprints for how galaxies fit together. These three interactive visualizations help us imagine the cosmic web, show us differences between the models, and give us insight into the fundamental structure of the universe.

### Author(s):

### Abstract:

Topobox is an implementation of an open source project at U.C. Davis supported by the National Science Foundation. Topobox consists of a sand table, a scanner, and a projector. The scanner (a Kinect 3D Scanner) detects the height and placement of the sand in the basin and, using the software from U.C. Davis, calculates the appropriate projection and transmits the information to the projector, which then projects topographic lines and colors onto the corresponding sand below.
