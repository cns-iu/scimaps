Ward Shelleyâ€™s work gives curious shape to cultural history
-----------------------------------------------------------

Artist Ward Shelley guides us through the twists and turns of his astonishing _History of Science Fiction_ (2011) and reveals how he creates his biomorphic cultural narratives. Shelley discusses the role of the artist as storyteller, the different priorities of science and art, and the benefits of having a squid-shaped sense of time.
