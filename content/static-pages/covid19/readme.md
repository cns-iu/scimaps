COVID-19 Visualizations & Data Resources
========================================

  

The “Flatten the Curve” visualization captured, in one powerful image, the importance of individual action in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data visualizations have taken center stage as we all struggle to make sense of the impacts of this world-wide event. The diversity of maps, graphs, and dashboards that have sprung up in just a few months is truly impressive, and we have compiled a list of our favorites, along with a few older maps that have new relevance. At the end, you will find a list of data sources in case you are inspired to create your own COVID-19 visualization.  
  

Maps from the _Places & Spaces_ Exhibit
---------------------------------------

Designed in 2007 to model behavior and understand future epidemics, “Impact of Air Travel on Global Spread of Infectious Diseases” shows how dramatically air travel changes the game. The 2014 “PREDICT: Health Map” captures USAID’s Emerging Pandemic Threat Program’s dynamic health alert system for identifying emerging infectious diseases. Both maps demonstrate how critical past research has been in understanding and responding to COVID-19 today.
