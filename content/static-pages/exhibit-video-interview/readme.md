This video from the early days of _Places & Spaces_ provides an up-close-and-personal view of science maps and the talented individuals that create them. Curators Katy Börner and Deborah MacPherson and mapmakers Kevin Boyack, Brad Paley, Dick Klavans, André Skupin, and Henry Small are on hand to share insights into the science visualizations, reveal how they are created, and discuss the power of mental maps to help us better understand the structure of science.
