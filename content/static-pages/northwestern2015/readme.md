_Places & Spaces_ at Northwestern University
============================================

May 14 - September 23, 2015
---------------------------

Are you interested in seeing science from above? Curious to see what impact one single person or invention can have? Keen to find pockets of innovation? Desperate for better tools to manage the information flood? Or are you simply fascinated by maps? Then plan to visit the _Places & Spaces: Mapping Science_ exhibit, which will be on display at the [Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine](http://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/) from May 14 to September 23, 2015.  
  
The exhibit aims to demonstrate the power of maps to navigate and make sense of physical places and abstract topic spaces. Scientists will be stimulated, students and teachers encouraged, and the general public fascinated by this multi-layered, accessible approach to the worlds of modern scientific thought.  
  
This is only the third time the [10th iteration](/iteration/10/ "10th iteration"), which debuted in September 2014, is being displayed publicly. These fascinating new maps explore the future of science mapping and continue the exhibit’s commitment to bringing audiences the most stunning and groundbreaking examples of data visualization from the most brilliant mapmakers of our time.  
  
The maps and bonus materials will be on display in the [Galter Health Sciences Library](https://galter.northwestern.edu/ "Galter Health Sciences Library").
