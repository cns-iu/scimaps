Call for Maps for the 10th Iteration of the _Places & Spaces: Mapping Science_ Exhibit on “The Future of Science Mapping” (2014)
================================================================================================================================

**Background and Goals**  
The _Places & Spaces: Mapping Science_ exhibit was created to inspire cross-disciplinary discussion on how to best track and communicate human activity and scientific progress on a global scale. It has two components: (1) physical exhibits enable the close inspection of high- quality reproductions of large-scale maps for display at public places such as science museums and libraries as well as at conferences and (2) the online counterpart ([scimaps.org](http://scimaps.org)) provides easy access to zoomable maps, their descriptions and references as well as information on their makers.  
  
_Places & Spaces_ is a 10-year effort. Each year, 10 new maps are added, which will result in 100 maps total in 2014. Each iteration of the exhibit attempts to highlight outstanding examples of visualization design. To accomplish this goal, each iteration compares and contrasts four existing maps with six new maps of science. Themes for the different iterations are:

*   1st Iteration (2005): The Power of Maps
*   2nd Iteration (2006): The Power of Reference Systems  
    
*   3rd Iteration (2007): The Power of Forecasts  
    
*   4th Iteration (2008): Science Maps for Economic Decision Makers  
    
*   5th Iteration (2009): Science Maps for Science Policy Makers
*   6th Iteration (2010): Science Maps for Scholars  
    
*   7th Iteration (2011): Science Maps as Visual Interfaces to Digital Libraries  
    
*   8th Iteration (2012): Science Maps for Kids  
    
*   9th Iteration (2013): Science Maps Showing Trends and Dynamics  
    
*   10th Iteration (2014): The Future of Science Mapping

_Places & Spaces_ was first shown at the Annual Meeting of the Association of American Geographers in April 2005. Since then, the physical exhibit has been displayed at over 250 venues in 23 countries, including 15 in Europe, as well as Japan, China, Brazil, Chile, South Africa, Australia, Canada, and the United States. A schedule of all display locations can be found at [scimaps.org/exhibitions](http://scimaps.org/exhibitions).

  

**Submission Details**  
The 10th and final iteration of the exhibit is devoted to maps of science that point to the future of the practice itself. Micro to macro studies using quantitative and/or qualitative data are welcome, and mixed methods approaches are encouraged. Maps should be understandable by a general audience and might answer questions such as:

*   How does the structure and dynamics of science evolve?
*   How does science interact with technology?
*   How can developments in science and technology be communicated to a general audience?
*   How can maps of science achieve more extensive and more accurate coverage?
*   How can maps of science be updated in near-real time?
*   How does science overlap with other areas of human endeavor and interest?
*   How do predictions of scientific developments impact the course of history—i.e., can self-fulfilling prophecies be prevented?

To fit the theme of the 10th iteration, submissions should innovate on one or more topics such as:

*   New data sources—social media, stock market, philanthropy, and other data that captures S&T activities.
*   New hardware and software setups—multi-modal man-machine symbioses that combine analog human wet-ware and digital computer hard+software to achieve superior capabilities.
*   Proof of concept—science maps that are widely used.
*   Validation—results of user evaluation and algorithm cross-validation studies.
*   Standards—well defined, widely shared data formats, analysis and visualization workflows, but also visual languages.

Given the topic of this iteration, two types of submissions are welcome: (1) Photographs or conceptual sketches of future innovative science map usage—see [Otlet’s Mondothèque](/mapdetail/mondothÃ¨que_multimed_123) for inspiration. Ideally, the proposed interface or novel usage are paradigm-shifting—disruptive ideas are most welcome. (2) A visual rendering of a dataset together with a legend, textual description, and acknowledgements as required to interpret the map. Maps can be abstract, geographical, or feature-based (e.g., network layout), but are typically richer than simple x-y plots. Data can be used to generate a reference system over which other data—e.g., career trajectories—are overlaid. Data can also be projected onto an existing reference system (e.g., a map of the world). Maps should present fully formed ideas and analysis; they should not be simple sketches of “what we plan to do.” See [this PDF map collection](http://scimaps.org/exhibit/docs/PS_AllMapsPoster_2013_web.pdf) for an overview of the 90 maps already featured in the exhibit. Given the theme of this iteration, links to interactive web sites, hands-on displays, or interactive tools are strongly encouraged.  
Each initial entry must be submitted by January 31st, 2014, and needs to include:

*   Low-resolution version of map
*   Title of work
*   Author(s) name, email address, affiliation, mailing address
*   Copyright holder (if different from authors)
*   Description of work: learning objectives addressed, data used, data analysis, visualization techniques applied, and main insights gained (100-300 words)
*   References to publications or online sites in which the map appeared
*   Links to related projects/works
*   At least three keywords

Entries should be submitted via EasyChair [by clicking here](https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sciencemappingfronti). Submit map as pdf file. Enter author info, a title, and three keywords. Submit all other information via the ‘Abstract’ field.

  

**Review Process**  
All submissions will be reviewed by the exhibit advisory board. Submissions will be evaluated in terms of

*   **_Scientific value_**—quality of data collection, analysis and communication of results in support of clearly stated learning objectives. Appropriate and innovative application of existing algorithms and/or development of new approaches. This criteria includes the notion of relevance—submissions should showcase the “future".
*   **_Value for decision making_**—what major insight does the map provide and why does it matter? Is the map easy to understand by a general audience? Does it inspire viewers to learn more about science and technology?

**Final Submission**  
Authors of winning entries will be contacted early February and invited to submit final entries by April 30th, 2014. Each final entry should consist of:

*   Title of Work
*   Author(s) name, email address, affiliation, mailing address
*   24 x 30 inch (61 x 76.2 cm), 300 dpi, landscape version of map using [this template](http://scimaps.org/exhibit/images/Matte_300DPI.psd) (13.9 MB)
*   Official map description (200 words)
*   Biographies for all authors (about 100 words each)
*   High resolution portraits of all authors that are no smaller than 360 x 450 pixels, or 1.2" x 1.5" (3 x 3.8 cm) at 300 dpi. Larger is always better since we can always crop them down to our specific needs for both print and web.
*   Signed copyright and reproduction agreement

Map makers are welcome to use the expertise and resources of the exhibit curators and designers when designing and producing high resolution versions of final maps. The layout and production of the 10th iteration maps are expected to be ready for display by mid-June, 2014.  
  
Winning mapmakers will be invited to submit a ~1500 word paper for inclusion in a special _Places & Spaces_ edition (October 2014) of the ASIST Bulletin, which is widely read, referenced, and used in classrooms. These papers should include the information from the official map description along with additional detail on data, methods, and how the maps and visuals can be interpreted. Submissions will be due by June 30, 2014. Boyack and Börner, the editors of the special issue, will work closely with the authors to create copy-ready papers.
