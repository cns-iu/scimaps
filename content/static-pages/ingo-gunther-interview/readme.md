Ingo Günther: Artist of spherical information
---------------------------------------------

Artist Ingo Günther reflects on his involvement with _Places & Spaces_, the idea behind _Science on a Sphere_, and why everyone loves a globe. Günther explains how representing socio-political issues on a globe’s surface forces both artist and audience to resist distortion and selective interest in order to gain a more comprehensive perspective on world events.
