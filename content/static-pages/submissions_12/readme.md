### [Science On a Sphere](http://sos.noaa.gov/What_is_SOS/index.html)

_NOAA_

  

Science On a Sphere® (SOS) is a room sized, global display system that uses computers and video projectors to display planetary data onto a six foot diameter sphere, analogous to a giant animated globe. Researchers at NOAA developed Science On a Sphere® as an educational tool to help illustrate Earth System science to people of all ages. Animated images of atmospheric storms, climate change, and ocean temperature can be shown on the sphere, which is used to explain what are sometimes complex environmental processes, in a way that is simultaneously intuitive and captivating.

  

Science On a Sphere® extends NOAA's educational program goals, which are designed to increase public understanding of the environment. Using NOAA's collective experience and knowledge of the Earth's land, oceans, and atmosphere, NOAA uses Science On a Sphere® as an instrument to enhance informal educational programs in science centers, universities, and museums across the country. Science On a Sphere® is available to any institution and is currently in operation at a number of facilities in the US.

### [Smart Mapping](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/smart-mapping)

_ESRI_

  

Smart mapping is an exciting new capability that will change how you make maps in ArcGIS. Whether you're an expert or novice, with smart mapping it's never been easier to create visually stunning maps that tell the stories you want to tell. This capability is currently available in ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS for Server. See details at [esri.com/software/arcgis/smart-mapping](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/smart-mapping) and a demonstration [here](http://video.esri.com/watch/4184/smart-mapping-mapping-made-easy).

### [D3 on Angular](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/smart-mapping)

  

Quoting from [http://slides.com/nonononono/using-d3-with-angular-js#](http://slides.com/nonononono/using-d3-with-angular-js#): “D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation. AngularJS is what HTML would have been, had it been designed for building web-apps. Declarative templates with data-binding, MVW, MVVM, MVC, dependency injection and great testability story all implemented with pure client-side JavaScript.”

  

CNS has internally developed a visualization framework that leverages many other JS libraries. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for managing workspace and build tasks. [Angular](http://angularjs.org/) to provide dynamic visualization binding and scoping. [D3js](https://d3js.org/), [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), and [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) are used to create the data visualizations. By creating AngularJS directives that wrap D3.js, one can use the power of AngularJS's data binding to create apps with beautiful visualizations.

Elastic Terrain Map
===================

![](images/submissions12/ElasticTerrainMap.jpg)

### Website(s):

[elasticterrain.xyz](http://elasticterrain.xyz/)  

### Author(s):

Jonas Buddeberg and Bernhard Jenny

### Abstract:

The Elastic Terrain map is a novel way to answer one of the most fundamental questions about planet Earth: What is the shape of its surface—from highest mountains to deepest marine trenches—and what is the influence of this shape on flora, fauna, and human activities? Elastic Terrain animates terrain to add a visual depth cue to standard two-dimensional maps. Map panning is augmented with ephemeral animation, making it easy for map users to experience the third dimension of terrain in an engaging new way. Elastic Terrain helps the user to easily see the third dimension of valleys and mountains both on land and under water and explore its great influence on the life on Earth’s surface.  
  
The interpretation of terrain in traditional 2D maps is challenging for many. Terrain in Google Earth and other virtual globes is often easier to read than traditional 2D maps. Yet, these three-dimensional representations require complex interactions for navigation and camera control, they occlude large parts of the terrain, and their perspective distortion makes estimating distance and elevation difficult. The Elastic Terrain map is a new lightweight alternative that combines the simple navigation and overview of 2D maps with ephemeral terrain animation. It uses motion as an efficient visual cue for depth perception when the map is dragged or when the user explicitly shears the terrain.  
  
Elastic Terrain extends the OpenLayers web-mapping framework, using WebGL for hardware-accelerated rendering in web browsers. Various publicly available maps, satellite images, and digital elevation models are combined. Elastic Terrain runs best in a recent version of the Google Chrome browser.

RPYS i/o: A web-based tool for the historiography and visualization of citation classics, sleeping beauties and research fronts

### Abstract:

Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy (RPYS) and Multi-RPYS provide algorithmic approaches to reconstructing the intellectual histories of scientific fields. With this brief communication, we describe a technical advancement for developing research historiographies by introducing RPYS i/o, an online tool for performing standard RPYS and Multi-RPYS analyses interactively (at http://comins.leydesdorff.net/). The tool enables users to explore seminal works underlying a research field and to plot the influence of these seminal works over time. This suite of visualizations offers the potential to analyze and visualize the myriad of temporal dynamics of scientific influence, such as citation classics, sleeping beauties, and the dynamics of research fronts. We demonstrate the features of the tool by analyzing—as an example—the references in documents published in the journal _Philosophy of Science_.

The gravity apple tree
======================

### Website(s):

### Author(s):

Mariana Espinosa

### Abstract:

After 100 years of the publication of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, one can find dozens of alternative theories in literature –some of them valid in some specific regime– that have been proposed in order to solve some of the problems the explanation of this force still present: unification with other forces, singularities, cosmic homogeneity, dark matter problem and dark energy. In order to give context in a synthetic, interactive and communicative manner that would relate authors, main concepts and crucial experiments is that the Gravity Apple Tree was designed.  
  
The tree is a reinterpretation of conceptual trees extracted from partial contexts by formal concept analysis.2 Such contexts express classifications on metric, gauge, mondian and F(R) theories.34,5,6 Classifications and reviews provide bibliography to seminal papers that constitute a database that relates 128 main articles, 1968 cites, 40515 references, and their abstracts, as well as geospatial and temporal data. The Gravity Apple Tree has been a guide for further visualizations such as reference and cite networks, geospatial maps, topical networks and temporal topic networks obtained using Network Bench and Sci2tool.  
  
The gravity apple tree is presented in PREZI, an interactive online zoomable tool that links to DOIs of selected papers. It is embedded in a temporal framework that allows a follow up of branches in more detail, connecting synchronic events. Observations and experiments (or not theoretical developments), are placed in the temporal space, pointing out several relations, such as restrictions for branches to keep growing. An example of this is Einstein’s addition of the cosmological constant and his retraction after Edwin’s Hubble measurements of expansion. In the same way, one can point out the growth of new branches in synchrony with new observations such as the dark energy branch with the observation of accelerated expansion of supernovas 1a. The life of a branch depends as well on the number of people that keep working and successfully develops such theory in some way. Juicy debates can be brought on what roots, apples and branches should refer to. Personally, I interpret apples as the knowledge obtained by the exploration of a road taken, and branches representing.

### Website(s):

[excellence-networks.net](http://excellence-networks.net)

### Author(s):

Lutz Bornmann, Rüdiger Mutz, Moritz Stefaner, and Felix de Moya Anegón

### Abstract:

The application is based on papers (articles, reviews and conference papers) published between 2007 and 2011 in 17 subject areas. For each subject area, those institutions (universities and research­focused institutions worldwide) were selected in the SCImago Institutions Ranking which published at least 500 papers in the publication period. We refer to these institutions as "reference institutions". For every reference institution, the collaborating institutions were identified. Collaborating institutions are those which have co­authored at least ten publications with the respective reference institution. We refer to the collaborating institutions as “network institutions”. We estimated statistical models (Bayesian multilevel logistic regressions) for the 17 subject areas. The statistically estimated best paper rates are visualized, which the reference institutions have achieved with its network institutions. Co­authorship networks (based on institutional affiliations) show how successfully overall an institution (reference institution) has collaborated compared to all the other institutions in a subject area, and with which other institutions (network institutions) an institution has collaborated best.

### Abstract:

Knowledge Graphs are data structures to organise and aggregate heterogeneous correlations between multiple types of entities. They are adopted to strengthen search results and empowered by from factual and public information in collaborative data. While search is a technological commodity and an established paradigm in information retrieval, discovery of new and actionable information is still missing of a universal approach, no matter of the knowledge expertise in a domain or technical savvy to access it.  
  
This paper focuses on human-computer interaction design and visualisation of knowledge graphs for knowledge discovery as internet service.

Smelly Maps

### Abstract:

Despite the fact humans are able to discriminate several thousands different odors, city officials and urban planners deal only with the management of few bad odors. This negative and oversimplified perspective comes from the difficulty of measuring smell at scale: cities are victims of a discipline’s negative perspective. The goal of Smelly Maps is to open up a new stream of research that celebrates the complex smell fragments of our cities, by contributing to the development of a critical voice for the positive and negative roles that smell has to play in the design of a city.  
  
To create the smellscape of a city, first we created a lexicon of smell-related words. We then obtained social media photos geo-referenced in the city that matched our lexicon. Using tags associated to the photos, we built a co-occurrence network with the hypothesis that if two tags often co-occur in the same photo they belong to the same smell macro-category. Identifying clusters in the co-occurrence network we were able to observe the emergence of 10 different smell categories (e.g., nature, emissions, food, animals, and so on) that striking resemble the smell categories from the urban olfactory literature.  
  
Depending on where those photos were taken, we mapped the presence of smell categories in each street segment. To ease illustration, we colored each street segment with the corresponding most prominent smell; in addition, we provided a toolbox that enables the exploration of the entire smellscape of a street and the visualization of its emotional qualities showing how different smell footprints are perceived. The interactive web interface allows a search by street name and it provides the urban smellscape of 12 major cities worldwide.
