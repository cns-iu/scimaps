    In March of 2020, scientists, doctors, and public health experts joined
    forces to develop vaccines and public health strategies for reducing
    COVID-19 infection rates. Rapid progress was possible because it drew on
    fifty years of previous research and a pool of 15,500 research papers that
    dealt with coronavirus in some way. Macroscopemaker André Skupin developed
    this knowledge map of coronavirus research early in the pandemic, using
    network science techniques to develop an overview of existing research.
    Research was concentrated in nine distinct research clusters. Having this
    research “lay of the land” was useful for breaking down silos between
    domains. It also made it possible to  build response teams with the right
    mix of subject matter expertise.
