  body: "Perhaps this describes your situation: You know that the term “machine
    learning” has been around since the 1950s, but now everyone is talking about
    it and you are embarrassed to admit you have no idea what it means. Fear
    not—Stephanie Yee and Tony Chu have created an accessible introduction to
    machine learning that is so fun to use that you’ll be excited to learn more
    about what it can do. The scrollytelling-style presentation begins by
    proposing a problem: How would a machine know whether a building is in San
    Francisco or New York based on criteria that have nothing to do with its
    location on a map? Taking us through the process, Yee and Chu cleverly
    visualize how machines are trained to use “if-then” statements to clearly
    distinguish one object’s data points from another. The goal, of course, is
    not only to have the machine identify with 100% accuracy a building’s
    location but also to use that model to make predictions in other situations
    and with other data. This predictive power is what makes machine learning so
    powerful, and A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning is a great first
    step in understanding how to put that power to use."
