    This macroscope was developed as a journalistic project by *elDiario.es*, an
    online newspaper based in Spain. More than 200 GB of cadastral data, which
    includes building footprints and property boundaries, was downloaded and
    combined into a single database that includes every building in the country.
    The information was verified, building construction dates were confirmed,
    and building heights were calculated. The project involved massive amounts
    of geographic data compilation, processing, and analysis.


    The data tells a larger historical story about how and why Spanish housing developed with a priority on vertical growth. Early theories of disease, migration to cities in the mid-twentieth century, funding for elevators, and a brief period of urban sprawl in the 1980s have all left their mark on the built environment. Sit back and enjoy a bird’s-eye flight across the landscape of Spain.
