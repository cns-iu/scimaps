    Today’s digital atlases pull together massive amounts (insert units) of data
    in order to present a comprehensive view of a topic. Given this volume of
    data, machine learning techniques are critical for analyzing or identifying
    patterns in the underlying data. This macroscope demonstrates key machine
    learning approaches using a dataset about houses, with a goal of identifying
    whether houses are located in New York City or San Francisco. Brush up on
    data dimensions, finding boundaries, and decision trees by scrolling through
    *A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning*.
