  body: Given the overwhelming amount of research devoted to the coronavirus over
    the last few years, the need is greater than ever for a map that organizes
    and makes sense of all that science. Fortunately, cartographer and
    information visualization expert André Skupin, whose In Terms of Geography
    was included in the very first iteration of Places & Spaces, has returned to
    the exhibit with Coronavirus SoS. When Covid-19 first captured the attention
    of the scientific community, research into the virus did not have to begin
    from scratch. As Skupin’s work demonstrates, early Covid-19 researchers
    could build off of a solid foundation of coronavirus studies going back over
    fifty years. Since then, of course, work on the virus has exploded, crossing
    the boundaries of many research fields in the process. Coronavirus SoS
    represents those knowledge domains as areas on a map, indicating topical
    overlap through relations of proximity and distance. What emerges is a
    valuable guide for coordinating the educational opportunities and
    multidisciplinary research teams needed to effectively confront this
    worldwide health crisis.
