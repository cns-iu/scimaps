  body: "When you live in the city, the design of public space impacts your
    quality of life. The presence of bike lanes, tree canopies, benches, and
    public greenspaces can all add to residents’ health and happiness. However,
    as this macroscope demonstrates, these amenities are more common in whiter,
    wealthier communities—and it is this spatial inequity that contributes to
    racial and economic disparities across the city as a whole. Spatial Equity
    NYC, a collaboration between MIT’s Norman B. Leventhal Center for Advanced
    Urbanism and Transportation Alternatives, fosters data transparency by
    collecting and making usable a wealth of city data. Users can search New
    York City neighborhoods to find correlations between planning decisions and
    negative health outcomes. Spatial Equity NYC encourages activism by
    equipping users with data-driven solutions and connecting them with
    opportunities for direct social action. Even if you do not call NYC your
    home, this macroscope can serve as an inspiration and a model for data-based
    engagement with the urban space in which you live or work.  "
