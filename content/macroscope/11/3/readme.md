  title: Mapping Global News
  iteration: 11
  sequence: 3
  body: >-
    This macroscope was created by Kalev H. Leetaru, an expert on big data and
    global society. It uses as its source material, quite literally, the news of
    the world. The visualization explores how new stories group countries into
    distinct clusters, creating an inherent geographic network structure over
    the planet akin to “communities” as seen through the eyes of the world’s
    presses. In essence, for every monitored news article published anywhere in
    the world, it compiles a list of the other countries also mentioned in those
    articles.  
      
    It is important to note that this is not how often coverage from a country
    mentions other countries; it is how often coverage from any country in the
    world that is about that country mentions other countries. In other words,
    it is about context.  
      
    Countries that are frequently mentioned together might reflect geographic
    proximity, but also economic and political ties, or joint involvement in a
    major international event. Blue incoming lines indicate countries where at
    least 10% of the coverage mentioning the source country also mentioned the
    selected country. Red outgoing lines indicate countries where at least 10%
    of the coverage mentioning the selected country also mentioned the
    destination country.  
      
    The size and number of energy pulses moving along the line indicate the
    percentage of co-occurring mentions. In a given week, nearly every country
    is mentioned alongside of every other country at least once, so the
    visualization uses the cutoff of 10% to highlight only the strongest
    relationships. More information on this project can be found at
