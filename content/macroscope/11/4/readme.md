    University of Texas art historian Maximilian Schich and Mauro Martino, head
    of IBM’s Watson Cognitive Visualization Lab, created Charting Culture, which
    debuted in August of 2014 and went on to accumulate over 1 million views on
    YouTube.  
      
    In just five minutes, the animation covers 2,600 years of European and
    American history, from 600 BCE to 2012 CE, by tracking 120,000 individuals
    whose birth and death locations were recorded in the knowledge web Freebase.
    The figures whose migrations are traced are remarkably varied: from the
    Greek mathematician Pythagoras to the American Jazz Age entertainer Al
    Jolson, from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius to the Gothic painter Henry
    Fuseli, and from the composer Carl Maria von Weber to the father of
    sexuality studies, Havelock Ellis.  
      
    Birthplaces, represented by blue dots, are connected by arcs to places of
    death, denoted by red dots. The animation reveals how increased
    concentrations of death places indicate how different cultural centers rise
    and fall in importance: for instance, how Paris and London supplant the
    dominance of Rome, how New York pulls Europeans from their places of birth,
    and how America’s west coast lures Easterners to cross plains and mountains
    with promises of a new life. Further information on the data, making, and
    research behind this project can be found at
