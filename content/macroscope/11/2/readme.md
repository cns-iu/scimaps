    _AcademyScope_ represents a collaborative effort between the National
    Academy of Sciences and Indiana University’s Cyberinfrastructure for Network
    Science Center. This interactive visualization encourages viewers to explore
    all reports published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,
    and Medicine in the last twenty years.  
      
    By using this discovery tool, viewers may browse reports by topic and
    subtopic, see the relatedness of reports via elaborate networks of book
    covers dynamically displayed on the screen, and access detailed information
    about individual reports. This version of _AcademyScope_ consists of two
    main interfaces. The Topic View provides a proportional depiction of the
    number of titles within each sub-topic network. Sub-topic globes display
    relative publishing activity within individual sub-topics. The Sub-Topic
    View displays a network representation of the relationship between Academies
    reports based on full-text lexical analysis of each publication. This allows
    the user to highlight any given title and its related publications and also
    to view the number of titles published in that sub-topic by year.
