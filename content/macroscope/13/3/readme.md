    Every day, millions of Americans weave together a new geography of commuter
    patterns. These interlinked megaregions, connected by economic ties, suggest
    that new kinds of geographic categories are necessary if we wish to
    accurately describe the functional network of flows and relationships which
    shape our lives in the modern world.

      

    _Megaregions of the US_ is the work of historical geographer Garrett Dash
    Nelson, a postdoctoral researcher at Dartmouth College, and Alasdair Rae, an
    urban and regional data analyst at the University of Sheffield in England.
    The colorful starbursts are made up of approximately four million lines.
    Each line shows the linkage of commuters between one census tract and
    another, with the width proportional to the number of commuters, based on
    data from the 2010 census. Using an algorithmic technique called _community
    detection_ to group statistically significant clusters of related places,
    the map is then divided up into distinct megaregions.

      

    Can you find your own hometown, your own commute, and your new megaregion?
    Look for places on the map where many commutes cut across megaregional
    boundaries, and for other places where a single city acts as a center of
    gravity for commuter traffic. What might our political and planning systems
    look like if we made these megaregions the basis for dividing up the United
    States?
