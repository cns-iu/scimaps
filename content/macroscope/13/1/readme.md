  title: The Cosmic Web
  iteration: 13
  sequence: 1
  body: >-
    The concept of the cosmic web—viewing the universe as a set of discrete
    galaxies held together by gravity—is deeply ingrained in cosmology. Yet,
    little is known about the architecture of this network or its
    characteristics. Visual researcher and information designer Kim Albrecht
    worked with Albert-László Barabási, of Northeastern University’s Center for
    Complex Network Research, and a team of astronomers to construct multiple
    models of the cosmic web. The project team used data from 24,000 galaxies to
    offer blueprints for how galaxies fit together. The resulting interactive
    visualizations helped the team imagine the cosmic web, showed them
    differences between the models, and provided insight into the fundamental
    structure of the universe.

      

    Immerse yourself in a network of 24,000 galaxies with more than 100,000
    connections. By selecting a model, panning and zooming, and filtering the
    data, you can compare three distinct models of the cosmic web.
