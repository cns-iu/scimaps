    Northeastern University’s Center for Complex Research members Kim Albrecht
    and Albert-László Barabási worked with Roberta Sinatra, a theoretical
    physicist from Budapest, to analyze the publication histories of nearly
    10,000 scientists working in seven disciplines, connecting each paper with
    its long-term impact on the scientific community. They found that the most
    influential work of a scientist’s career is randomly distributed within her
    body of work. That is, the highest-impact work has the same probability of
    falling anywhere in the sequence of papers published by a scientist. It
    could be the first publication, appear mid-career, or emerge last. The team
    coined this the random impact rule.

      

    This visualization shows the random impact rule in all its power. You can
    explore careers in different disciplines and rank scientists according to
    different career parameters, like the total number of papers in each
    scientist’s career. You will find impact peaks occurring all over the place,
    from the beginning of a career on the left to the end of a career on the
    right.
