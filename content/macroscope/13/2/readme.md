    _Histography_ is an award-winning interactive timeline. The site draws
    historical events from Wikipedia, and updates itself daily as new events are
    added to the online encyclopedia. Matan Stauber, currently an interactive
    designer and code developer in Tel Aviv, created _Histography_ as a final
    project at Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem. Using bars at
    the bottom and left of the screen, you can filter events by time and by
    category. Or touch the green box in the top left corner of the screen to
    view an edited collection of stories. The pink square in the top right will
    then take you back to the main screen. Visit Histography online at
    [http://histography.io](http://histography.io).
