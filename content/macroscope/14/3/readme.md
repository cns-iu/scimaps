    _The Appalachian Overdose Mapping Tool_ shows county-level overdose
    mortality data. Select overlays of socio-economic factors like poverty,
    unemployment, educational attainment, and disability to look for patterns
    and trends throughout Appalachia. You can zoom in and display data for each
    of the 420 Appalachian counties, or compare rural and urban counties within
    Appalachia. See how the opioid epidemic has grown by comparing data from two
    time periods: 2007-2011 and 2012-2016.

      

    _The Appalachian Overdose Mapping Tool_ supports community planning and
    response, particularly in terms of strategies to address the opioid crisis.
    The tool uses data from the Centers for Disease Control’s National Vital
    Statistics System, the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, and
    the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and
    Wages. The tool was developed by Ned English, Megan Heffernan, Peter Herman,
    and Michael Meit, all associated with the non-partisan research organization
    NORC at the University of Chicago.
