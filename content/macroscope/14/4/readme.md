    Public information about violence often presents an up close and personal
    view of the effects of violence. _Violence Info_ takes the opposite
    approach, stepping back and looking at interpersonal violence at a global
    scale. A project of the World Health Organization (WHO), _Violence Info_
    draws on over 3,000 sources, including published scientific studies, WHO
    Global Health Estimates, and WHO’s 2014 _Global Status Report on Violence
    Prevention_.

      

    Each of the six forms of violence presented here--homicide, intimate partner
    violence, sexual violence, elder abuse, youth violence, and child
    maltreatment--affects us on a surprisingly large scale. Nearly half a
    million people are murdered each year, and 23% of children are physically
    abused, with long-term consequences to their well-being. Click a statistic
    to be directed to a body of research on that topic. Knowledge is power, and
    the World Health Organization hopes that, by making the research accessible,
    we can work to predict and therefore prevent violence. Designed and
    developed by Interactive Things for the World Health Organization, the
    project was supported by the Public Health Agency of Canada, UBS Optimus
    Foundation, and the United States Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention.
