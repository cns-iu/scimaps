    Food trends come and go. In this visualization from Mortiz Stefaner and Yuri
    Vishnevsky, the rise and fall of ingredients, drinks, diets, and regional
    cuisine are beautifully mapped on a year clock, a new form of data
    visualization thats hows patterns through seasons and years. Composed of
    over 130,000 data points pulled from Google Trends, the ebb and flow of the
    past 12 years of food trends are revealed. Some insights are predictable.
    Searches for turkey peak in November around Thanksgiving and chocolate has a
    spike in February near Valentine’s Day. Other patterns reveal changes in our
    collective diet as people turn their attention (and stomachs) to cauliflower
    and cronuts. _Rhythm of Food_ is a collaboration between Google News Lab and
    Truth & Beauty.
