    When people talk about climate change, they use words like temperatures,
    storms, drought, cyclones, and polar bears. When scientists talk about
    climate change they use words like observations, models, and temperature
    anomalies. Are we talking past each other when it comes to climate change?
    Or do we share a common language?

      

    _Climate Tweetoscope_, developed by David Chavalarias and Maziyar Panahi,
    illustrates areas of divergence and overlap in the climate change
    conversation. Use the Science view to explore more than 30,000 scientific
    articles analyzed for the 2015 Sustainable Innovation Forum in Paris. The
    larger the topic, the more often it is used. Compare this to the Twitter &
    Media view, which analyzes more than 47 million tweets posted from January
    2017 through April 2018. Green topics get balanced attention from scientists
    and from the public, whereas red topics are primarily discussed in research
    and blue topics are mostly addressed on Twitter.
