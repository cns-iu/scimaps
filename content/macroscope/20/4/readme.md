  body: With the short news cycle and fewer in-depth reporting formats, it is
    difficult to grasp progress over time in the areas of health, the
    environment, and education. The Shape of Change reintroduces prominent news
    stories that piqued awareness about issues like oil dependency, air
    pollution, and global literacy and then invites you to test your impressions
    of how things have changed. Further down, a series of charts track
    developments in key areas. For each year, a wedge shape indicates whether
    change in that area was positive or negative. By challenging you to reflect
    and then state your impressions about global challenges, Rita Costa and
    Beatriz Malveiro seek to replace subjective perceptions with empirical data
    in a way that makes those insights memorable.
