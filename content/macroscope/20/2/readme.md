  body: The joy of imaginative map exploration is perfectly captured in this
    visualization from graphics journalist Sam Learner. Begin by placing a
    virtual drop of water anywhere in the world, and watch as it makes its way
    through streams, tributaries, and rivers, tracing a path to the ocean or an
    inland sea. Hydrologists at the United States Geological Survey collaborated
    with the Internet of Water Coalition (did you know there is an internet of
    water?) to create a database of the world’s interconnected watersheds. This
    soaring perspective allows for amazing views of the landscape while also
    showing the distance a water drop travels to complete the water cycle.
