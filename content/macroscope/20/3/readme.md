  body: "*The Whole Picture* looks at one of our most crucial networks: the global
    supply chain. It reveals how disruptions, delays, or sanctions can affect
    the flow of goods in unexpected ways. It’s easy to see how problems with
    grapes in Italy could lead to a shortage of wine in Europe. You might be
    less aware of how a shock to U.S. soybeans can affect pork and poultry
    production in Panama, Egypt, and Indonesia. By using a network model that
    accounts for both food and the materials that go into producing it, a team
    led by the Complexity Science Hub were able to capture the interdependent
    nature of this vital global system."
