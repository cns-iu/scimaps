  body: This winner of the 2023 World Data Visualization Prize helps you compare
    nations of the world according to 31 economic, social, and environmental
    metrics. Understanding that context is key, visualization designer Lindsey
    Poulter developed this dashboard to encourage comparison by region and
    income level. A high-income country, for instance, may have a lower
    percentage of people living in poverty than many other nations around the
    world. However, that same statistic may not look so great when compared only
    with other high-income countries. You can get acquainted with this
    macroscope by pressing the shuffle button at the top of the dashboard. This
    will show how data points are arranged on both the main radial graph and the
    dot plot in the sidebar. From there, you can select comparisons from the
    drop-down menu. Or you can get more specific information by hovering over
    individual data points.
