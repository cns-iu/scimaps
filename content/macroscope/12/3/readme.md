    While it may be simple to estimate which research institutions are at the
    top of their game, creating a statistical model to objectively measure and
    map this is no small feat. Lutz Bornmann, a sociologist of science at the
    Max Planck Society, Rüdiger Mutz, a Swiss researcher in social psychology
    and higher education, Moritz Stefaner, an independent data visualization
    expert, and Félix De Moya Anegon, senior researcher at SCImago (a well-known
    research group dedicated to information analysis), took up the challenge and
    created Excellence Networks.  
      
    The web application shows how universities and research institutions
    collaborate. Institutions in the SCImago Institutions Rankings were
    categorized by subject area. Each institution was then mapped in relation to
    its collaborators. Co-authorship networks show how successfully (in terms of
    citations) an institution has collaborated compared to others within a
    subject area, and with which other institutions a specific institution has
    collaborated most successfully.  
      
    Pick a subject area and see which institutions publish collaboratively and
    who they work with. When they collaborate, do they produce high impact
    papers? Do they collaborate locally or are their major collaborators on
    other continents?
