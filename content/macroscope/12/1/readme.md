    What does your street smell like? Humans can differentiate thousands of
    different odors. Yet, city officials and urban planners deal only with the
    management of a few bad odors. In creating _Smelly Maps_, University of
    Turin computer science professor Rossano Schifanella and Bell Labs
    researchers Luca Maria Aiello and Daniele Quercia teamed up to introduce a
    new stream of research that celebrates the complex aromas of our cities and
    makes it possible to use this information in urban design.

      

    To map urban smellscapes, the project team first created a lexicon of
    smell-related words. Then, they gathered geotagged social media posts from
    Flickr, Instagram, and Twitter that included smell-related words. Finally,
    the smells people posted about were mapped on each street segment.

      

    Click on a street to see how it smells. As you might expect, nature smells
    are strong near parks and animal smells dominate at the zoo. Where do you
    find the strongest food smells?
