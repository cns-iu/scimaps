    Created by FleetMon, a company that provides live vessel tracking, this
    visualization animates a week of ship traffic on the seven seas as seen from
    space. The movements of hundreds of thousands of vessels were captured using
    shore and satellite-based tracking data from FleetMon and its partner,
    Luxspace.  
      
    Many cargo ships, tankers, ferries, cruise ships, yachts, and tugs carry
    transponders that transmit their locations. That data is then made available
    to amateur ship spotters and maritime businesses alike through the
    interactive _FleetMon Explorer_ tool. Using the tool, you can follow the
    flow of jet fuel and agricultural commodities around the globe, track a
    fleet of cruise ships in real time, or monitor traffic at ports around the
    world.
