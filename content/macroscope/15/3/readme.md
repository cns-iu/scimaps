    This macroscope shows, county by county and state by state, how median
    household incomes compare. Although Virginia has a median income above the
    national average, it has the largest difference between high income and low
    income counties. Do see any trends? If you reorder the states based on the
    difference between high earning counties and low earning counties, where
    does Arkansas (AR) fall?

      

    Data presented here is drawn from the American Community Survey, an ongoing
    annual survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau. It is used for
    many purposes, including community planning for hospitals, schools, bridges,
    and new business ventures.
