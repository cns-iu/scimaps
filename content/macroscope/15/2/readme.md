    Designed for the 2017 French presidential election, _Politoscope_ has since
    been on display in the Terra Data exhibit at the Cité des Sciences, the
    biggest science museum in Europe. _Politoscope_ provided a way for the
    public to take the pulse of online communities during the last month of the
    2017 French presidential election, and provided access to the candidates’
    positions on major political issues over several months.

      

    _Politoscope_ uses millions of political and media tweets to visualize
    socio-semantic trends using a new methodology to reconstruct the
    socio-semantic dynamics of political activist Twitter networks. The
    macroscope makers are convinced of the need to make this kind of analysis of
    social media available to regular citizens as well as political elites.

      

    How do you feel about the connection between social networks and electoral
    processes worldwide? Has real-time analysis of social media ever influenced
    your political opinion? Should it?
