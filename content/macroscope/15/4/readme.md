  title: Making Sense of Skills
  iteration: 15
  sequence: 4
  body: >-
    The skills needed in the workplace are changing. With the development of
    artificial intelligence and advances in robotics, what skills will remain
    valuable in the job market? Using machine learning,
    [Nesta](https://www.nesta.org.uk/) (funded by
    [ESCoE](https://www.escoe.ac.uk/)) built a skills taxonomy to group skills
    based on how often they appeared together in job descriptions across the UK.
    The more frequently two skills appeared in the same advertisement, the more
    likely it is that they ended up in the same branch of the taxonomy. Skills
    were then clustered based on growth in demand and on salary.

      

    Search the resulting matrix to see which skills are in high demand and which
    are waning. Where does your dream job fall in this visualization?
