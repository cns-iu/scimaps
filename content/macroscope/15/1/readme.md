    Beginning in 2015, Europe saw a dramatic increase in the number of people
    seeking refuge from drought, poverty, and violence. Many crossed the
    Mediterranean Sea or traveled by land through Southeast Europe from the
    Middle East and Africa. _Refugee Flow_ is a tool for the exploratory
    investigation of this migration crisis. Combining multiple data sets with
    interactive visualizations, the project aims to increase understanding of
    human trajectories.

      

    The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that 68.5
    million people are forcibly displaced around the world. Funding to tackle
    the current challenge is decreasing, not increasing. By 2050, the continued
    impact of climate change will forcibly displace 1 billion people.

      

    Collecting data on people who, because of circumstances beyond their
    control, are unlikely to be documented, is a challenge. Refugee Flow draws
    on data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) to
    visualize factors that cause people to leave their home countries. This data
    is combined with the International Organization for Migration’s _Missing
    Migrants_ data set to visualize causes of death for those en route. A third
    data set connects adverse outcomes upon arrival with news stories of
    struggles faced by migrants.
