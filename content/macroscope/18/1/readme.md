    Celestial objects have the distinction of being, at the same time, both
    mundane and mysterious. Although we see them on a regular basis, we realize
    that such sightings convey only a fraction of what there is to know about
    them. And that’s what makes this macroscope from data experience designer
    Jan Willem Tulp such a valuable tool for star gazers of all stripes. Using a
    partial data set from the European Space Agency’s Hipparcos mission, *Star
    Mapper* enables the interactive exploration of nearly 60,000 stars.
    Different filters allow different features of the stars to come to the
    forefront: you can toggle between apparent and absolute magnitude views,
    study how stars evolve with the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and track the
    movement of stars through space. 


    Zoom in to get a stellar view of these fascinating celestial objects. Or select the “Motion” tab to see the movement of stars over the next several million years.
