    Do the city social spaces we visit—the restaurants, museums, stores, parks,
    and entertainment venues we go to—tend to attract people from various income
    levels?  The *Atlas of Inequality* uses aggregated anonymous location data
    from digital devices to estimate the income levels of individuals visiting a
    variety of city spaces. For each location, an inequality metric is devised
    to capture the levels of income segregation throughout our urban areas. 


    Created by Esteban Moro, Alex ‘Sandy’ Pentland, Xiaowen Dong, and Dan Calacci, all current or former members of the MIT Media Lab, the Atlas serves as a resource for policymakers, journalists, researchers, and citizens interested in understanding and alleviating the far-reaching effects of economic segregation and inequality.
