    Social determinants of health (SDOH) are community conditions known to have
    a significant effect on people’s health and well-being. You might be
    surprised at the number of things that affect a person’s health. These could
    include everything from access to grocery stores with healthy foods to the
    availability of opportunities to acquire language and literacy skills. Use
    this macroscope to search for specific SDOH measures by individual county or
    Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) and track changes to those measures over
    time. Understanding spatial and temporal patterns of SDOH will help
    researchers and policymakers make informed decisions about public health
    research and practice.
