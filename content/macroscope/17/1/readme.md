    As this macroscope demonstrates, the neighborhood in which a child grows up plays a substantial role in determining his or her future economic mobility. Using research from Raj Chetty, John N. Friedman, and Nathaniel Hendren of Opportunity Insights, and constructed by Joey Cherdarchuk, Eugene Chen, and Daniel Haight of Darkhorse Analytics, the Opportunity Atlas measures the average economic outcomes of children from every neighborhood in the United States, by demographic subgroups like race, gender, and parental income. An essential tool for policymakers, community organizers, and advocacy groups, the _Opportunity Atlas_ enables targeted, data-driven solutions that proactively address income inequality.
