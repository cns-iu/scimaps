  title: "Mapping Inequality: Redlining in New Deal America"
  iteration: 17
  sequence: 2
  body: >-
    Created by digital historians Robert K. Nelson and LaDale Winling, _Mapping Inequality_ allows users to explore the infamous redlining maps and area descriptions produced by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC), a New Deal agency, between 1935 and 1940. Redlining had enormous long-term consequences, helping to channel private and public capital to white families through homeownership, effectively denying such access to African Americans and other Americans of color. _Mapping Inequality_ presents these maps interactively over a digital mapping interface, allowing users to select areas and explore the thousands of area descriptions—transcriptions of which are also visualized to enable easy comparison of each data field for all neighborhoods in a selected city.
