    The _Atlas of Surveillance_ is a collaborative effort between the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Reno Reynolds School of Journalism at the University of Nevada. Through a combination of crowdsourcing and data journalism, they are creating the largest-ever repository of which surveillance technologies are being used by which law enforcement agencies. The _Atlas_ focuses on the most pervasive technologies, including drones, body-worn cameras, face recognition, cell-site simulators, automated license plate readers, predictive policing, camera registries, and gunshot detection. The aim of the _Atlas_ is to serve as a resource for journalists, academics, and concerned members of the public to check what technologies are used locally and how different technologies are deployed across the country.
