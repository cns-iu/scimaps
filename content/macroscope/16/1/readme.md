    Scrollytelling, a mashup of “scrolling” and “storytelling,” is a web format
    that uses interaction to tell complicated stories online. _United States
    Water Crisis_ by Andrew Levinson is a great example of the scrollytelling
    format.

      

    Multiple data visualizations, drawing on data from a variety of government
    agencies, expose the severity of the crisis from different perspectives. How
    much water is used to irrigate farms? How much money do we need to fund
    infrastructure repairs for drinking water? How full are underground
    aquifers, which operate like the savings account of our water supply? Use
    the many kinds of charts and graphs illustrating the story to find answers.
