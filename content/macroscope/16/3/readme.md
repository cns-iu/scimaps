  title: An Alternative Data-Driven Country Map
  iteration: 16
  sequence: 3
  body: >-
    One way to understand a country is to compare it to others. This macroscope
    lets you pick metrics for comparison. How much education do citizens have?
    How much does the government spend on health care? How effective is the
    judicial system? Using this award-winning macroscope by Nikita Rokotyan,
    Olya Stukova, and Dasha Kolmakova of Interacta studio, you can raise or
    lower indicators in a country’s profile to see how that metric shapes
    quality of life for citizens in that country.

      

    This macroscope uses a machine learning algorithm called t-SNE, a technique
    for simplifying data with multiple dimensions while retaining meaningful
    properties of the data. The algorithm groups countries based on their
    similarity in a high-dimensional space and then projects the solution into a
    lower-dimensional space to make it easier to see. Because the algorithm can
    analyze really complex data, it might find similarities between countries
    that people wouldn’t otherwise notice or investigate.
