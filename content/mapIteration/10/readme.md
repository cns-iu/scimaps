iteration: 10
title: The Future of Science Mapping
---
This 10th and final iteration aims to inspire continuous innovation and the utilization of science mapping by featuring visualizations of:

*   Physics—from the 6th century B.C. to the present—to communicate key theoretical starting points, streams of thought and well-known diagrams.
*   The Internet with old and new continents of websites and services.
*   Emerging pandemic threats in the developing world for early detection of viruses from wildlife with pandemic potential.
*   Roman transportation that shows the impact of geography and seasonality on transportation time, costs, and the dominance of cities.
*   Money to illustrate possession and expenditure from dollars to trillions of dollars.
*   Citation contexts to provide insight on the internal organization of scientific papers.
*   Funding portfolios to compare and coordinate funding efforts across agencies.
*   Graphene publications and patents to help illustrate innovation dynamics in support of business and policy decision-making.
*   Altruism to understand the commonalities with and differences from scientific activities.
*   Interstitial organizations that create bridges between civic ideals, managerial concepts, and scientific assessment.
