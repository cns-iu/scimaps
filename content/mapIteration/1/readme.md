title: The Power of Maps
---
The first iteration of this exhibit aims to show the power of maps to help understand, navigate, and manage both physical places and abstract knowledge spaces.  
  
The first maps of our planet were neither complete nor entirely accurate. Yet, they were invaluable for navigation, exploration, and communication. They helped explorers avoid monsters and find promising lands. Maps of science developed today are not perfectly precise either since they are generated based on only a small portion of humanity’s scholarly knowledge. The generation of comprehensive and accurate maps requires the proper interlinkage of multilingual, multidisciplinary, and multimedia scholarly knowledge.  
  
Note that each of the six early maps of science displayed uses a different metaphor. What metaphor is most effective in designing a visual index of humanity’s knowledge and expertise?
