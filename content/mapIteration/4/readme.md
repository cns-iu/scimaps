title: Science Maps for Economic Decision Makers
---
This is the first of six iterations that explore the utility of science maps for different stakeholders. The maps presented here meet the needs of economic decision-makers. They answer questions such as:

*   What is the impact of war on global trade flows?
*   How do accelerating communication and transportation speeds impact our lives?
*   What events and time lags occur from basic research to product sale?
*   What are the (social) networks behind illicit deals and laundered money?
*   What intellectual property space is claimed by whom, and what growth is expected?
*   What is the ecological footprint of a country, and how sustainable is it?
*   How does the ‘Product Space’ determine the economic development of nations?
*   How to visually empower strategy formation and value creation in organizations?
*   How are publications linked to patents in different areas of science?
*   What factors impact the happiness of citizens, and which countries experience the most happiness?
