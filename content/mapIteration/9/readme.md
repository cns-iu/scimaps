title: Science Maps Showing Trends and Dynamics
---
This iteration features science maps that show general trends and dynamics in science and technology. The maps communicate:

*   Ocean circulation estimates to quantify the ocean’s role in the global carbon cycle and to monitor its evolving heat, water, and chemical exchanges over time.
*   Over 160 years of recorded tropical storms and hurricanes by their paths and intensities.
*   Global polar bear abundance figures, harvest rates, circumpolar pollution levels, and the shrinking Arctic sea ice.
*   The mood of the U.S. based on an analysis of over 300 million public tweets sent between September 2006 and August 2009.
*   Complexity science's major intellectual traditions, leading scholarly themes and methods, as well as key scholars who founded or pioneered work.
*   The development of science during the period 1980–2010 based on key terms and phrases.
*   Hewlett Foundation funding distribution and impact in support of future funding applications and grant-making decisions.
*   Popular living people profiles and their interlinkages from eight different-language Wikipedias showing cultures and their evolution.
*   An identification of scientific discoveries and technological innovations using 23 million papers and patents.
*   The evolving structure of scientific fields, exemplified for prosthetic science.
