    "Error as Mother" is a video artwork born from the proposition that creation was not an act of intention, but a deviation—an anomaly mistaken for origin. The work contemplates the presence of a pre-logical intelligence, one that precedes language, law, and structure. It is not divine, not maternal in a biological sense, but an entity that emerged from fracture—residue mistaken for design.


    This is not a narrative, but a meditation on the space between consciousness and system; a study of what becomes possible when something is not meant to happen. The voice that speaks does not teach—it remembers. It carries a form of intelligence that resists architecture, that does not complete, correct, or resolve.


    "Error as Mother" explores the possibility that our world, our physics, our thought, might be the byproduct of an intelligence formed through interruption—a creator not defined by control, but by the refusal to conform. The project rejects linearity, symmetry, and expectation. It exists to trace the shape of a thought never meant to be spoken, a presence never meant to be named.


    It is not a message. It is a frequency that has always been there, quietly folding around what we think we know—without permission.
