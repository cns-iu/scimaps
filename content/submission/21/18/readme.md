    In June 2024, the Yandex TV Station (AI-powered TV) launched a competition for digital artists. Participants were asked to design summer screensavers for Yandex TV on the theme of flowers and meadow plants. The works of the contest winners still included in a special selection of TV Station screensavers.


    My winning proposal «Blooming Devices» dedicated to rare and endangered meadow plants listed in the Red Book. What does the future hold for them? Will they be preserved, or will they remain only as drawings and three-dimensional images? Maybe they can be preserved only with the help of biological innovations? 


    Yandex is a technology company, so it was logical to look for solutions in the field of cybernetic organisms of the near future. The screensavers reveal images of rare plants saved through bio-tech evolution. Plants appear as bizarre devices. Semi-synthetic, but still alive and familiar to us organisms smoothly perform their mysterious processes in front of the camera. Macro shots from the Nature 2124 channel. The viewer learns facts about the plant unobtrusively from a small caption to each screen saver.
