    Visualising AI: Responsibility is a series of visuals I developed in collaboration with Google DeepMind as part of their public engagement program.


    The project illustrates the human component embedded within machine learning algorithms, particularly in data enrichment practices. Using computer-generated imagery and animation, it employs symbolic and metaphorical visual language to represent the mechanics of data enrichment, emphasizing the human presence at the center of machine learning models. It visualizes how different data types cluster within automated AI systems, and where human intervention occurs, represented through the presence of hands that refine and alter the data.


    I chose to represent machine learning as a human–machine system: a symbiotic ecosystem that foregrounds the social and cultural dimensions of software, since a significant amount of human labor remains essential in areas such as data enrichment, algorithm design and adjustment, and data governance. This work highlights the ethical responsibility carried by both developers and systems as they shape intelligent technologies.


    The project was developed in collaboration with Will Hawkins, a AI researcher at Google DeepMind, and is based on his paper co-authored with Brent Mittelstadt, The Ethical Ambiguity of AI Data Enrichment: Measuring Gaps in Research Ethics Norms and Practices, published in June 2023.


    Designed to be accessible to both technical and general audiences, the work has been published across platforms including DeepMind’s website and social media. It aims to foster visual literacy around emerging technologies and encourage deeper public engagement with the ethical, emotional, and symbolic layers of machine intelligence.


    Special thanks to the wonderful Visualising AI team at Google DeepMind – Emma Yousif, Gaby Pearl and Ross West – for their collaboration and support throughout the development of this project.
