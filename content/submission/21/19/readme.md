    This artwork explores the interaction between different forms of intelligence that coexist within the human body — microbial, bodily, and neural. These intelligences do not function hierarchically, but rather in constant exchange: through signals, impulses, and biochemical flows.


    The human gut microbiota is one of the largest symbiotic life systems within us. It produces neurotransmitters, affects hormonal cycles, and — as recent research shows — can influence our emotions, food preferences, and even behavioral responses. These microbial signals reach the brain via the vagus nerve, cytokines, and short-chain fatty acids.


    In the painting, these signals are visualized as luminous streams rising from the lower part of the composition — the metaphorical gut — toward the brain. There, they undergo cognitive processing, the result of a delicate coordination between the body, microbiota, and consciousness.


    This internal dialogue culminates in an exhale — the release of carbon dioxide, a measurable product of metabolic exchange. On the canvas, this is depicted as a cloud of light — a metaphor for the energy shaped by the combined activity of multiple intelligences. Here, the act of exhalation becomes not merely a physiological function but the trace of collective thinking, a shared gesture shaped by many agents.


    The work transforms invisible interaction into an abstract visual language. It invites us to see the body not just as a vessel of thought, but thought itself as a product of a living, multispecies ecosystem — one that thinks with us and through us.
