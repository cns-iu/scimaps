    Insertion Loss

    “Insertion Loss” explores the collaboration between human emotional intelligence and artificial intelligence in the search for new forms of non-verbal communication. The title refers to a term in telecommunications: the weakening of a signal as it passes through a system. SHUM uses this concept as a metaphor for emotional expression — fragile, distorted, often lost in translation between people.


    The work questions the dominance of language as the primary tool for connection. There are emotions we struggle to express. There are words that don’t exist in other languages. There is always something lost.


    This video artwork combines sound design, AI-generated content, and Lev Kuleshov’s montage theory to immerse the viewer in a meditative state — a quiet co-tuning with another presence. Artificial intelligence is not a tool here, but a co-author, helping to reconstruct emotional signals into an audiovisual language.


    “Insertion Loss” visualizes a hybrid form of intelligence: one that senses, interprets, and responds. It points to a near future where technologies might read and translate our emotional and physiological states — hormonal changes, facial microexpressions, nervous system responses — and transmit them as shared experiences.


    Rather than offering a utopia, the work suggests a subtle shift: from explaining to sensing, from interpreting to co-feeling. In a time when language grows louder but not clearer, perhaps cooperation between intelligences — human and artificial — can open new emotional channels.
