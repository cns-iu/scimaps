    The Shakespe(AI)re project is an artistic-scientific video installation in the realm of AI-assisted art with artist-driven processing. Using cutting-edge technology, it combines microbiology and medieval poetry. This project explores human relationships through artistic means by examining the processes of interaction and communication among bacteria. The Shakespe(AI)re project exemplifies a hybrid practice, training AI to "think" at a high creative level.

    Shakespeare is renowned for his 154 sonnets—a poetic form originating in the 13th century. A Sonnet Crown is a complex poetic cycle based on the acrostic principle. It consists of 15 sonnets, with the final one—Magistral—written first, serving as the thematic and structural foundation of the cycle. Upon discovering that, despite his prolific output, Shakespeare never wrote a Sonnet Crown, I resolved to rectify this gap. For the Magistral, I selected Shakespeare's Sonnet 144, which depicts the poet’s entangled relationships with a dark-haired woman and a fair-haired young man—allegories of the eternal human struggle between the forces of good and evil.

    While researching Bio-art, I studied microbial behaviour in Prof. Noam Stern-Ginossar’s microbiology lab at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Using microscope-generated images and videos, I observed the intricate dynamics of microbial interactions—far beyond mere symbiosis or competition. These behaviours, with their dramatic, tragic, or sacrificial elements, possess a scale of emotional intensity akin to Shakespearean drama. Inspired by these findings, I envisioned Shakespe(AI)re as a project that mirrors human relationships through the hidden world of bacteria.

    Using AI tools like ChatGPT 4.0 and Gemini, I "completed" the 14 missing sonnets to form a Sonnet Crown, effectively becoming an inadvertent “co-author” with Shakespeare. Hundreds of verses were refined to match the rules and cadence of Shakespearean versification. With Suno AI, I composed music and selected vocal performances for the new sonnets. Using MidJourney, I created bacterial imagery, while Vivago program helped me craft short video reels, ultimately integrating them into the video-project 28-minute 4K video installation.
