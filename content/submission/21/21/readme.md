    Data, body, pixels, fluids, neural networks, nature, life, databases, all moshed up. Generated videos in the uncanny valley, realistic yet not quite, bleed into each other by different modes of "glitch." It's a poem for human existence and the processing of it, by organic forces and technological powers. A hybrid is created, an audio-visual documentary of the hyperreal, or perhaps a living form, born from the history of our dreams and hallucinations. A material, perhaps maternity, for thought, and thought as material/maternity. Perception of existence, creation of substance, and the impact of time, that's the thematic core, empowered by new technology to re-reflect.
