    Artificial Worldviews is a series of inquiries into the system underlying ChatGPT about its descriptions of the world. Utilizing prompting, data gathering, and mapping, this project investigates the dataframes of »artificial intelligence« systems.


    Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning methods are often referred to as black boxes, indicating that the user cannot understand the inner workings. However, this trait is shared by all living beings: we come to know a person not by examining their brain structures but by conversing with them. The so-called black box is not impenetrable since we can gain an understanding of its inner workings by interacting with it. Through individual inquiries, we can only acquire anecdotal evidence of the network. However, by systematically querying chatGPT's underlying programming interface, we can map the synthetic datastructures of the system.


    In my research, I methodically request data about large-scale, indefinable human concepts and visualize the results. These outputs visualize expansive data structures and unusual, sometimes unsettling worldviews that would otherwise be unimaginable. The terms »power« and »knowledge« unfold vast discourses from philosophy, politics, social sciences to natural sciences, they hold multidimensional meanings within social relations. The resulting graphics resemble narratives found in the works of Franz Kafka or Jorge Luis Borges, representing an infinite library of relational classifications, bureaucratic structures, and capricious mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion.


    Artificial Worldviews is a project by Kim Albrecht supported by metaLAB (at) Harvard & Berlin, the Film University Babelsberg KONRAD WOLF, and the Folkwang University of the Arts. The project is part of a larger initiative researching the boundaries between artificial intelligence and society.
