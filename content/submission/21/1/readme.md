    The Opera of Dying Insects addresses the global tragedy of the insect apocalypse, driven by industrial farming, habitat loss, climate change, deforestation, and pesticide use. Studies reveal a 40% decline in insect populations and a 76% drop in flying insects over 27 years. As insects are vital to pollination and the food chain, this crisis has far-reaching consequences.

    This sound and video installation features pill bugs (Armadillidium Vulgare) thriving in a moist, constructed environment with domestic insects, fungi, and bacteria. As they consume and decompose a wet log, their movements are tracked by cameras and analyzed with artificial intelligence software. This data triggers an evolving tragic opera they compose. The ecosystem is built from locally sourced soil and insects. A small cube of earth, including branches and pill bugs, are transplanted from a local forest into a glass vitrine. After the exhibition, the soil is returned to its original habitat. 

    Projected visuals magnify the pill bugs’ micro-world and insects that are going extinct, encouraging viewers to appreciate their subtle beauty and recognize their critical role in ecosystems. The work aims to inspire a deeper awareness of the fragile interconnectedness of life on Earth.
