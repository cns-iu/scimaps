    ReCollection: You Only Have Seven Seconds is a poetic, AI-generated documentary that visualizes human fading memory at the intersection of remembrance and imagination. Against the backdrop of rising Alzheimer’s cases and the emergence of machine-generated false memories, the video reimagines remembrance through the lens of artificial intelligence. Inspired by her grandmother’s cognitive decline, the artist created a custom AI system that transforms fragmented spoken recollections into synthetic visual sequences. Presented as a public interactive AI art installation, ReCollection has welcomed thousands of visitors from around the world to whisper their fading memories—each within seven seconds—into the artwork and generate visual memories in real time. These visual memories—constructed through speech recognition, text auto-completion, and text-to-image generation—form the foundation of an evolving visual archive.


    Drawing from the audio and generative image data collected through the ReCollection installation, the video incorporates emerging speech-to-video technology to weave a collective, culturally diverse montage of love and loss. Initially conceived as a personal reflection, ReCollection has evolved into a living, breathing, shared worldbuilding experience for memory recreation—where the ephemeral past is not restored, but reassembled into a dynamic portrait of collective human selfhood.
