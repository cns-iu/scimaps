    "Dimensional Fluctuation" is a rule-based procedural visual 

    generative system that bridges pure mathematics—complex 

    analysis, algebraic geometry, topology—and applied fields like 

    numerical analysis and combinatorial design for artistic 

    visualization. It employs hierarchical decomposition and modular 

    synthesis of algebraic sub-equations to generate intricate patterns 

    and dynamic spatial forms. Implemented in Houdini with artistguided
     parametric controls, it visualizes complex geometric 
    universes inspired by science fiction, representing highdimensional
     spacetime described in string theory. This artwork 
    investigates new perspectives on abstract scientific concepts, 

    aiming to transform them into an intuitive and accessible artistic 

    visualization that engages wider audiences. This work envisions a 

    speculative visual universe where mathematics and physics 

    converge with artistic creativity, providing a distinctive perspective 

    for exploring the intricacies of interdimensional voyage.
