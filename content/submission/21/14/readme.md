    Latent Xylella is a triptych of olive trees generated by an artificial intelligence algorithm (GAN – Generative Adversarial Network), trained on over 10,000 photographs personally taken in the fields of Casarano, affected by Xylella fastidiosa, a bacterium that has decimated the centuries-old olive groves of Salento. The work explores AI’s ability to process memory, loss, and the transformation of the landscape.

    Developed according to the principles of Green AI, the algorithm shapes a landscape suspended between memory and loss. The images, emerging from the neural network's latent space, evoke an imaginary archive of what once was and perhaps will never be again: ghostly trees, like fading imprints. The triptych, a secular echo of the sacred, pays homage to the olive tree as a symbol of Apulian identity and resistance.

    The work visualizes the interaction between environmental, algorithmic, and emotional intelligence: human intelligence selects and curates the training images; artificial intelligence processes and transforms them; while emotional intelligence is activated in the viewer’s reception, recognizing in the ethereal forms the echoes of a collective identity at risk.

    Inspired by Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights, Latent Xylella responds to the need to understand how artificial intelligences can collaborate with human sensitivity to preserve and re-narrate wounded places. Latent Xylella imagines new roots from what remains, in a land scarred but still capable of telling its story.
