    ecocalypse is a post-anthropocene reality, a hypothetical moment of rupture, after which nature, deformed for centuries by human activity, is freed from industrial and cultural constructs. however, this freedom is illusory: not a return to the natural order, but an entry into a hybrid era, where the biological and technogenic, organic and inorganic mutate, giving rise to unexpected symbioses and life forms. a languid voiceover interpreting the ideas of dark ecology speaks about the pulsating topography of changes, in which survival is determined not by the previous laws of nature, but by the ability to adapt to a fluid reality, and the mutating neural network nature that reinforces the speech simultaneously attracts and frightens.
