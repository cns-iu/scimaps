    Abstract: 


    The Social Determinants of Health Visualization Tool is an R Shiny application that provides a user-friendly platform for public health researchers, policy makers and the public to examine spatial-temporal patterns of and relationships between social determinants of health (SDOH) measures known to influence health outcomes at multi-scales in the U.S.




    This visualization tool uses the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) SDOH beta database, which was curated from multiple Federal and publicly available data sources. Measures in the AHRQ SDOH database correspond to five key SDOH domains: social context (e.g., age, race/ethnicity), economic context (e.g., income, poverty), education, physical infrastructure (e.g., crime, environment), and healthcare context (e.g., health access, quality, behaviors). SDOH measures were collected for multiple years at two geographic levels in the U.S., i.e., county (324 variables, from 2009 to 2018), ZCTA (159 variables, from 2011 to 2018).




    Using maps created by the Mapbox GL JavaScript library, and associated scatterplots, summary tables, and graphs created by R Shiny, this tool can display a wide range of SDOH measures at scale. There are three key elements of the tool: 


    •        The Interactive Map tab renders county and ZCTA-level maps with options to select year and search for specific SDOH measure sorted by SDOH domain and topic. The zoom-in function allows for quick examination of SDOH in individual state and county.


    •        The Change Analysis tab provides side by side synchronized maps, a scatterplot with Pearson correlation test, a multi-group histogram and a summary table, allowing users to investigate temporal changes of a SDOH measure.


    •        The Pattern Comparisons tab further enables users to identify spatial associations and statistical relationships between different SDOH measures. 




    With these features, this visualization tool can be used to obtain critical insights into the spatial-temporal patterns in and associations between SDOH measures, thereby informing public health research and practice.
