    Abstract:


    ESA Star Mapper is an interactive visualization that lets a science interested audience explore what you can find in a star map. The data used for this visualization is based on the Hipparcos mission, which has measured the details of over 100.000 stars, at the time the largest such a collection of data about stars. The project was conceived as a stepping stone to a follow up mission, Gaia, in which measurements of 1.5 billion stars have been collected. The visualization allows users to interactively explore various measurements of more than  60.000 of the full dataset, including a real-time sped up simulation of stellar motion in the browser.
