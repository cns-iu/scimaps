    Abstract: 


    In over five years, we have published several releases of the www.excellencemapping.net tool revealing (clusters of) excellent institutions worldwide based on citation data. With the new release, a completely revised tool has been published. It is not only based on citation data (bibliometrics) but also Mendeley data (altmetrics). Thus, the institutional impact measurement of the tool has been expanded by focusing on additional status groups besides researchers, such as students and librarians. The excellencemapping.net is the first university ranking that includes altmetrics data to visualize the impact of institutional research beyond research itself. For example, the new release facilitates that those institutions worldwide can be identified with the highest impact of research on students. In the new release, the visualization of the data has been completely updated by improving the operability for the user and including new features, such as institutional profile pages.
