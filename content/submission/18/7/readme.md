    Abstract:


    Research with a focus on Humanities; first, maps were drawn by hand, then worked out with the help of Illustrator; they consist of several layers (translator, one specific translational project, other translations of the translator); they allow us to reconstruct certain movement patterns and shed a new light on translation as a social activity. The topic of the following maps are the translators of a history of Russia (written by Nikolay Karamzin) and published between 1818 and 1829 in St. Petersburg. The five translators translated the text into German. 




    Designed, developed, and narrated by Kim Albrecht, Matthew Battles, Fabian Dinklage, and Sydney Lewis
