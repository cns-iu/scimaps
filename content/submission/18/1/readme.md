    Abstract: 


    Economic inequality isn't just limited to neighborhoods. The restaurants, stores, and other places we visit in cities are all unequal in their own way.


    The Atlas of Inequality shows the income inequality of people who visit different places in cities around the U.S. It uses aggregated anonymous location data from digital devices to estimate people's incomes and where they spend their time.


    Using that data, we've made our own place inequality metric to capture how unequal the incomes of visitors to each place are. Economic inequality isn't just limited to neighborhoods, it's part of the places you visit every day.
