    Abstract:


    The "Data Science & Analytics Analyst" represents a deployment of BoKMap (Body of Knowledge Map), a platform for comprehensive exploration and analysis of knowledge spaces. Instead of treating popular notions of "understanding the innovation landscape" or "finding knowledge gaps" as mere metaphors, we leverage machine learning and data visualization to operationalize spatial intelligence. Inspired by geographic principles and cartographic techniques, a patent-pending workflow produced a knowledge reference system that effectively acts as a "GPS for knowledge" and powers an interactive base map and analytics engine. Users can now interact with abstract concepts and concrete documents with the ease of every-day web mapping tools, even without prior domain knowledge. This includes a unique ability to serendipitously discover concepts and documents by simply interacting with the map, by either double-clicking in it or drawing query geometry. The scope and volume of documents accessible through the app is evolving, but currently entails several hundred thousand documents, from tech articles to scientific papers.
