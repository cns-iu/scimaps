    Abstract:


    The IPCC Interactive Atlas is an innovative component of the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) supporting and extending the assessment provided in the report –in particular regional assessment– and improving transparency and re-use of climate information through the implementation of FAIR principles (Iturbide et al. 2021). The Interactive Atlas allows exploring over 25 essential climate atmospheric and oceanic variables (such as temperature, precipitation, wind and sea surface temperature, sea level rise, sea ice, and pH) and impact-relevant indices underpinning the report. These variable are computed for both multi-model global (CMIP6) and regional (CORDEX) climate change projections and can be analyzed along different climate change dimensions (future periods across scenarios or global warming levels) using a number of  innovative interactive data visualizations, such as global and regional maps,  ensemble time series, climate stripes, global warming level plots, etc.. A strong effort in data visualization has been made to communicate the uncertainty of the models, through hatching of the maps, and showing always an ensemble of climate models (instead of single-model results).


    The data processing was challenging and time-consuming (data access, curation index calculation, standardization and metadata provision, etc.), requiring over 1.5 million hours of computing time. The processing of climate data handled several hundred TBs of initial information, and distilled it down to a total of 2 TB, that is the final dataset handled by the Interactive Atlas.


    Two types of users were targeted. First, the IPCC researchers and practitioners, since the tool was issued as part of IPCC AR6. Second, education, media and the general public. . For the latter, a simple interface (climate futures) was deployed oriented to global warming levels, so users are directly confronted with the different policy relevant choices (our possible future worlds at 1.5º, 2º or 3º).
