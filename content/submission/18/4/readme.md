    Abstract:


    User group: This piece is for the science-interested public, students, and educators


    Data used: The macroscope is based on a research paper published in Science. The paper uses digitized photographs of eggs from 1400 bird species to show what factors are important in determining the shape of bird eggs. https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaj1945


    Data analysis: The researchers measured the eggs in the photos and used different approaches to determine how different egg shapes are formed in a bird and also which egg shapes correlate with other characteristics of a bird species, such as wing type.


    Viz techniques applied: 


    Packed circle diagram to show how many eggs, bird species, and orders were included in the data 


    Graph to show how bird egg shapes were characterized in the study


    Egg photographs used as data in the paper


    Animations of how different factors might influence egg shape  


    Graphs showing the relationship between egg shape and flight style 




    Main insights gained: CRACKING THE MYSTERY OF EGG SHAPE follows researchers’ efforts to solve a long-standing mystery in biology: Why are eggs shaped differently from species to species? The work visualizes results from the analysis of a data set of 1400 species’ eggs, cataloged in a repository of egg photographs collected over the course of 100 years. The site exposes viewers to the diversity of birds, egg shapes, and the mechanisms by which eggs are formed. It also demonstrates how science can use data from historical sources in new ways.
