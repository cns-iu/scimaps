    #### Methodology


    **Circle placement:** Priority was placed on avoiding overlap of circles. This means the placement of each circle will not always be 100% accurate. However, hovering over a value will provide the exact value.


    **Strong vs. Weak:** Each metric was assessed to determine if a higher value was better (strong) or worse (weak). For some metrics, such as % of GDP used for military spend, it is hard to determine what an ideal value is. In these instances, the metric was deemed to be stronger the higher it was.


    **Axis:** Stronger values are placed toward the top/outside. This means the axis may be reversed from a traditional chart. For example, infant mortality has a value of 10 at the top and 80 at the bottom. Additionally, the axis does not include 0. This is to emphasize the minimum and maximum values in the world.


    **Averages:** For each income and region level a standard average was calculated. Population was not taken into consideration. If the focus is a country, such as the United States, that country is included in its region and income level averages.
