    This interactive dashboard encourages users to focus on one area – a country, region, or income level – and see how it compares to its counterparts across a wide range of metrics. It provides multiple ways to interact and explore – the user can search for a country of interest, use the shuffle button to randomly select a focus, or change the selection via tooltips. For best experience, view on a large screen. Recognition: Winner of the World Data Viz Prize

      The main dataset and metric selection were sourced from [WDVP](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_xdns_UCtRNH9TWcxKYKa_HydlkZxbqCCYRfdxhUNpg/edit#gid=0). The right-hand side of this visualization details the original source of the data. Region and income level classifications originate from the World Bank, via [Gapminder](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qHalit8sXC0R8oVXibc2wa2gY7bkwGzOybEMTWp-08o/edit#gid=501532268).
