    This interactive dashboard encourages users to focus on one area – a country, region, or income level – and see how it compares to its counterparts across a wide range of metrics. It provides multiple ways to interact and explore – the user can search for a country of interest, use the shuffle button to randomly select a focus, or change the selection via tooltips. For best experience, view on a large screen. Recognition: Winner of the World Data Viz Prize
