    Measuring human development helps us understand how people’s lives and livelihoods vary across the world and how they have changed over time. 


    There are several prominent measures that try to capture these changes: 


    * The Human Development Index (HDI) 

    * The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) 

    * The Gender Development Index (GDI) 

    * The Augmented Human Development Index (AHDI) 


    The first three are published by the United Nations Development Programme. The AHDI, meanwhile, was developed by the economic historian Leandro Prados de la Escosura. 


    All these measures seek to broaden the scope of development beyond simple economic growth and to capture other key metrics that track peoples’ living standards. 


    However, measuring human development comes with many challenges. People do not always agree on what should be included. And even once defined, features of human development are difficult to measure. So how do these indices track human development? And what can we learn from them? We summarize the similarities and differences between the different approaches in this article and how to decide on which one to use.
