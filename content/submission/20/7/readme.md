    GeneticFlow, our Macroscope, is intricately designed for the academic user groups at large, e.g., researchers, educators, decision-makers, or even fresh students in universities and research institutions. The tool meets an important need of academic researchers on the in-depth analysis and interpretation of scholars' impact, streamlining tasks such as scientific career analysis, academic award selection, and tenure evaluation. For junior students, it also opens a door for visually understanding the career path and biography of prestigious scientists, e.g., Turing award winners and Nobel prize laureates. Now we focus on several areas inside the computer science discipline, including AI, database, graphics, visualization, etc., but we may extend the coverage to more disciplines in near future (e.g., physics, material). 


    The GeneticFlow tool mainly utilizes the comprehensive dataset provided by Microsoft Academic Graph, which encompasses an almost full coverage of academic data including papers, authors, citations, and topics, till 2021.10. At its core, the GeneticFlow tool designed a self-citation graph to visualize the evolution of a scholar’s research innovations, as well as their external impact. Cutting edge algorithms, including advisor-advisee detection, extend-type citation classification, embedding-based topic generation, and graph neural networks are employed in our tool for both effective visualization and downstream inference tasks. More details can be found in our KDD 2023, VIS 2023, and NeuroIPS 2023 papers. 


    The visualization design employs a time-dependent hierarchical graph representation, further augmented with appropriate color mapping, interactive trend charts, and a topical map view, providing multidimensional insights into temporal and thematic aspects of a scholar's research contribution and impact. Through extensive case studies and quantitative evaluations, we find that the GeneticFlow visualization can highlight the key success of top-ranked scholars. It also predicts high-level award recipients (e.g., ACM fellows), with significantly better performance than classical impact indicators such as h-index, i-10 index, and citation networks.
