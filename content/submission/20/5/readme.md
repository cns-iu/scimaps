    Can we estimate how much the world has changed in a decade? Or do our own experiences impact the perception of progress? The work, titled The Shape of Change, challenges our assumptions about how key statistical indicators regarding Health, the Environment, or Education evolve through the years. The work was done in the context of the World Data Visualization Prize, part of the World Government Summit 2023. For that year, the competition focused on the past, present, and future of society and governments. The goal was to create a tool to showcase how data visualization can show data on innovations, decisions, and metrics that can be used to drive and measure progress. The organization made available three datasets, from which participants should create the visualizations. The dataset used in this work contained yearly observations for statistical indicators between 2012 and 2022. The work is a scrolly-telling piece that starts by taking the reader through significant news stories of the past decade. The goal is to connect the reader to the indicators by remembering specific events. Then, they are prompted to guess how an indicator related to the event changed, challenging the perception of the immediacy of news stories with the continuous change during the decade. Additionally, it has been shown \[1] that users prompted to reflect on their prior knowledge by predicting and self-explaining improve their recall and comprehension of the data. These exercises also serve to introduce the user to the visual element used to represent change: the angle, direction, and color of the triangles. This knowledge is then needed to interpret the small multiples visualization at the end of the piece, where the reader can have a bird's-eye view of the yearly change for all the indicators.
