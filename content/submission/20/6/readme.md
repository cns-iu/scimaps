    This project explores the relationship between the capitalist system and its implications for climate change. Rooted in a critical examination of the capitalist pursuit of profit, perpetual consumption patterns, and the resulting inequality between citizens of “developed” and “developing” economies, it highlights the profound impact of these factors on the escalating climate crisis. Driven by H.A Baer’s work which emphasizes the role of capitalist ideology in perpetuating reliance on fossil fuels and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions \[1], we leverage data from the World Bank on greenhouse gas emissions per capita \[2], and the Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index (CRI) \[3]. The CRI is a weighted index of 4 measures used to evaluate the losses a country has experienced from extreme weather events connected to climate change. The losses analyzed are economic losses (absolute losses of purchasing power parity, and losses per GDP unit), and loss of life (number of lives lost, and deaths per 100,000 inhabitants). 


    The visualization was created in processing using particle systems and a physics library to simulate realistic hurricane behavior. Particles leave short trails and have a centrifugal motion: rotating closer to the center than in the outer rim. The hurricanes have different eye sizes, total sizes, and speeds based on data values. For very at-risk countries, you would see a large hurricane with a small eye rotating quickly. The particles extinguish when they reach the eye of the hurricane and are then reseeded in the periphery. Ultimately, we aim to visually represent climate vulnerabilities juxtaposed with global greenhouse gas emissions to shed light on the relationship between risk and emissions at the country-level granularity. We emphasize that for high emitting nations, while pollution has historical been something to bury or ship away, climate risk cannot be exported.
