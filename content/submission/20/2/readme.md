    The river runner tool helps people to better understand the interconnectedness of our watersheds by calculating the downstream path from anywhere on earth and visualizing the journey. 


    In its original iteration, it relied on the USGS's NLDI, which links water features and flowpaths within the United States. The dataset compiled for the global version created in collaboration with hydrologists at the USGS and the Internet of Water, though it remains a work in progress (particularly with regards to its coverage of water feature names). 


    The frontend for the visualization was built with svelte and mapbox, putting the user in control of a 3D journey from a place of their choosing to an ocean or inland lake. The aim was to zoom in with an immersive flyover experience to give a sense of how many places and communities are downstream of one another. I also wanted to provide navigation widgets in the corners to orient someone in the full network of streams, tributaries, and rivers it takes to reach an ocean or endhoric basin.

      There's a list of sources for the data/attributions here: https://ksonda.github.io/global-river-runner/ (Also a note that Dave Blodgett (USGS), Kyle Onda (Internet of Water) and Ben Webb (Internet of Water) should be credited somewhere for their work on the backend here, though I don't know if they'd like me to fill out full contact details for them on this form)
