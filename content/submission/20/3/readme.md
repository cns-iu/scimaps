    This interactive dashboard, created for the World Government Summit, aims to visualize the world's development indicators. The visualization presents different seasons, emphasizing various aspects. 


    Spring is a time of growth and development. 


    Summer is a time of prosperity, yet a few countries face economic hardship. Economic prosperity can also be seen as a sign of success and abundance. However, only some have equal access to these resources, and inequalities can arise when some people have more access to wealth, opportunities, and resources than others. 


    Fall is a time of change, as the leaves change color and fall to the ground. It is also a sign of the bounty for fruits.


    Winter is a time of preparation for crisis. Addressing the energy and climate crisis may require a collective effort to prepare for the challenges ahead. Snow here is a symbol of the challenges and difficulties that we face as a society. 


    In each season, it presents a tree that tells a performance story by visualizing the performance metrics of each sub-region and country. The tree roots present the global performances over the past ten years. The past provides the foundation for the present and future, just like the roots of a tree. 


    The sunlight and rain in the sky visualize the buzz of 20 development and 18 innovation frontiers from seven categories. Just as the future holds the potential for growth and development, development and innovation are like the sunlight and rain that provide energy and water for a tree to grow and flourish.
