    Abstract:  


    "Information and Violence" is an interactive data visualization that presents a timeline of major U.S. news headlines alongside monthly counts of gun sales and homicides from 2016 to 2021. Since 2016, the number of gun sales and homicides has been steadily increasing. By displaying them alongside the top news at the time, it aims to highlight the possibility of the psychological influence of fear and anxiety in society. Users can hover their cursor over the screen to view the gun sales and homicides data, and click on orange vertical lines to see the corresponding news headline.

      HOMICIDES = From 2016 to 2019, the data is from CDC WONDER Data Archive
      (https://wonder.cdc.gov/). From 2020, since the data publishing by CDC has
      been paused since the COVID pandemic, we used the estimated monthly
      homicide numbers from the report published by CCJ National Commission on
      COVID-19 and Criminal Justice
      (https://cdn.ymaws.com/counciloncj.org/resource/resmgr/covid_commission/Year_End_Crime_Update_Design.pdf).


      GUN SALES = Brady's estimated monthly gun sales (https://brady-static.s3.amazonaws.com/NICSdata-year.pdf), which is calculated based on NICS's background check for firearm sales (https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/nics).


      NEWS EVENTS = Significant news events picked from Wikipedia's list of incidents in U.S. 


      2016 in the United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_in_the_United_States), 


      2017 in the United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_in_the_United_States), 


      2018 in the United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_in_the_United_States),
