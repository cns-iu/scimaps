    Abstract: 


    Spatial Equity NYC documents inequities in the ways that public space — including streets, sidewalks, and greenspaces — is designed, distributed, and accessed. Browse citywide data or search community profiles to learn how decisions about the use of public space lead to unequal outcomes and what you can do about it.
