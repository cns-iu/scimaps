    Abstract: 


    Mapping the New Politics of Care displayed the effects of COVID-19 in the United States layering a wide range of social, economic, and environmental conditions on two interactive maps utilizing multiple vulnerability indexes. 


    The first map, titled Community Health Workers, asked viewers to imagine what would happen if one million community workers were allocated across the USA by comparing four indexes of vulnerability alongside COVID-19 data. A user can toggle between multiple vulnerabilities for the distribution of the workers, specific to each county. Making decisions like this responsibly requires confronting and addressing not just the virus but also the inequalities and vulnerabilities that propelled the pandemic.


    All people in the USA were granted the right to have access to free, safe, and effective COVID-19 vaccines over multiple federal distribution phases. But due to the limited doses available, the majority of states followed the Center for Disease Control’s recommendations to prioritize health-care personnel and long-term care facility residents in receiving the first vaccines. 


    The second map titled, Vaccine Allocation, focused on this first distribution, Phase 1A of the federal program and compared how each state could have distributed 22 million doses of vaccine more equitably. Users can compare Phase 1A allocation vs allocation to vulnerable populations county by county, in each state. Prioritizing vulnerability could have mitigated health inequities and protected communities that were more likely to have the first and most concentrated COVID-19 outbreaks.


    The vulnerabilities made visible in both maps predated the pandemic and created the conditions for the virus to flourish. Both maps display the acute inequalities embedded in the social and political landscape of the USA. This pandemic is not simply biological. It is a symptom of an illness in our body politic. As COVID-19 roared across the country, it followed the fault lines of social vulnerability.
