By Jackie Fleming, Visual Literacy and Resources Librarian, Indiana University Bloomington

As the Visual Literacy and Resources Librarian at Indiana University-Bloomington, I see it as my responsibility to help our campus community create, interpret, use, and understand visual information. This aspect of my position became even more essential in March of 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic caused campuses across the country to close and transition to online learning. While we were all trying to adapt to the pandemic related changes to our daily lives, we were also facing an immense amount of both textual and visual COVID-19 information that has now been labeled as an infodemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines an infodemic as, “an overabundance of information-some accurate and some not- that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it”. My colleague Theresa Quill, Maps & Spatial Data Librarian, and I, saw an immense need for general instruction on how to interact with COVID-19 data visualizations, infographics, and maps as a great opportunity to promote visual and spatial literacies. 

As academic librarians, literacies of all types are of primary importance to our profession. However, because Theresa and I both work closely with visual and spatial literacies, we decided to focus on promoting specific skills within those fields to help our campus community understand data visualizations, infographics, and maps related to COVID-19 (See Figure 1 for definitions of visual and spatial literacy). Now that we are over a year into our collaboration, Theresa and I have done several promotional activities that go beyond COVID-19 visualizations such as creating visual and spatial literacy teaching tools, workshops, and giving presentations. Through our collaborative work and research, we have discovered strategies, rooted in visual and spatial literacy, for reading and understanding data visualizations. Below, I will share three general strategies for interacting with different types of visual information.

1. Read ALL accompanying text

It is very important that you always read the text associated with a data visualization, infographic and map. This information will help you understand how the graphic is meant to be read and provide context for the visual. This text can include the title, caption, and key for the graphic (See Figure 2 for an example). 

2. Be Critical!

You should always be critical when analyzing visual information. Ask yourself: 

* What data drives this visual? Is it coming from an authoritative source? Is it accurate? 
* How is the data being generalized and/or organized in the visual?
* What information is missing from the visual? How would that information impact what is included in the visual? Why do you think the creator chose to leave that information out?
* Who made this visual and what are their biases? What are your biases and how are they impacting your own understanding of the visual?

These questions are not exhaustive, instead they are meant to help you start thinking critically about the visual information you contact on a daily basis. Depending on the visual, you might want to extend and/or adapt this list (See Figure 2 for an example).

3. Make sure the visual is updated

If you are looking at a visual that has time sensitive information, like a COVID-19 map or data visualization, you want to make sure that it has updated information. A creation date or last updated date can usually be found next to the creator's name. If this information is not made easily accessible, that is a sign that the visual might not be credible (See Figure 2 for an example). 

We live in a very visual society where we are constantly bombarded with visual information. Living in a visual society does not provide you with the necessary skills for understanding and creating visual information. In addition to the visual literacy and spatial literacy work that Theresa and I have done, the Indiana University Libraries are always brainstorming new ways to help our campus community build these skill sets. Please take a look at our website and keep an eye out for workshops, events, and research guides that might interest you. We are always willing to help!
