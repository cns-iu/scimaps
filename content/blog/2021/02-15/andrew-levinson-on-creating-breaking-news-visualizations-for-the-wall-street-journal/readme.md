I’ve worked with the Places & Spaces exhibit for almost nine years, so I’d like to think that I can keep my cool around just about any kind of data visualization out there. But I’ve got to tell you—election maps totally stress me out. 

I can’t be alone in this. After all, hasn’t every US election in recent memory felt like “The Most Crucial Election Ever in the History of Democracy”? Haven’t we all spent the last few election nights in an extended panic attack, peeking through our fingers at election maps as they turn red or blue?   I realize that this has less to do with the maps themselves and more to do with the fact that the last few US elections I can’t be alone in this. After all, when we are presented with an election map, three things are usually happening at the same time: 1) Steve Kornacke is jabbing at it and shouting;  2) We’re realizing that all those comforting polls we read were actually way, way off; and 3) we’re waiting for some polling place in Georgia to finish counting their votes so we can find out, you know, the fate of American democracy.

Two of the most important news stories of 2020 were communicated to us largely through data visualization. It was the year we spent many anxious moments studying pandemic maps to find which areas of the country were experiencing an uptick or a downturn in Covid-19 cases. Then, on November 6th, we watched and waited as election results maps tracked the political direction of the United States in swatches of red and blue. And, depending upon your chosen news outlet (and, of course, your political affiliation), you may have spent that evening and the days that followed either rejoicing over or cursing at the work of Places & Spaces contributor Andrew Levinson.

Levinson, a Brooklyn-based data visualization and digital products designer, is currently a member of the visuals team at The Wall Street Journal. There, he creates graphics and interactives with code for both breaking news and longer-term projects. As such, Levinson was deeply involved in creating election results visualizations for one of the most significant political contests in American history. 

For many of us, elections can seem like wildly unpredictable affairs—especially in light of some recent, well-publicized polling failures. But as Levinson points out, while the outcome of the contest may be unknown, the rules by which it proceeds are not. “One of the benefits you get from working on an election,” Levinson explains, “is that you know when it’s coming. You know that every two and every four years is a mid-term and a general election. . .. This pandemic election was unique in a lot of ways, but the rules are the same. There are electoral votes, and each state has a certain number. You know who the candidates are, which seats are up for election and which ones aren’t, what the rules are for when something goes to a runoff, how Maine and Nebraska differ in their electoral allocation. . . . So you need to be able to understand exactly what the parameters are for a US election to be able to present the data in the right way.”   

Indeed, the structured, rule-bound process of US elections allows for careful preparation and testing to occur well in advance. “So really early on we started on the design process. It was right before the primaries. One of the first ideas I brought to the table was using a cartogram for a map in addition to a normal geographic map. One that doesn’t distort the areas and, instead, presents each state sized according to the number of electoral votes they have, which makes it a bit easier to look at the national map and see the balance of blue and red. That design process and all those iterations were done in design software, in Sketch. Early on, it was meeting with editors and reporters, people that are experts, people that have worked in visuals on this kind of stuff before, working with our cartographers, as well. And just thinking of all these different ideas.”

As Levinson goes on to say, “There were a lot of meetings, a lot of worrying about the micro-interactions, all the little details. Working on every single platform: on the smallest phone to if someone wants to pull up our live results page on a projector or something. It will still work, it won’t break. So getting all those details down in the design process first, before starting to code, was extremely helpful.”

In the end, Levinson says that while “politics is hectic, we knew what we were going to show. Designing and planning for the data—there’s a range of data that could possibly come in. Even if we’re surprised that a candidate got more or less of the vote than we thought they would, the design still works regardless of that. Knowing the boundaries—no one can get 8,000 electoral votes, for instance—if you know the boundaries, you know the rules.”
