For centuries, travelers of all kinds have considered the cartographic map to be an essential tool for navigation. Even today, we rely upon maps to give us a sense of where we are in space, how we move from one place to another, and what we might encounter along the way. But beyond the merely practical, maps hold the power to fuel our desire for new knowledge and new experience. They provide us with the imaginative and intellectual thrill of rendering vastness visible. They provide an encompassing view of something that we, as individuals bound by time and space, can only see partially and imperfectly. 

Today’s maps of science perform a task similar to their geographical counterparts by providing an aerial view of an intellectual territory far too vast to be understood from ground level. Maps of science depict knowledge and expertise as a visible location and in relationships of distance and proximity. They mark those territories that have been well traveled—those ideas that have attracted the attention of many scholars over time—as well as those areas recently discovered and bursting with new activity. And, like those masses of land marked “There be MonstersParts Unknown” on some of our earliest maps of the world, we see that which is imperfectly understood and ripe for exploration. At their best, maps of science survey, plot, and visualize vast geographies of information and inspire exploration.

From 2005 to 2014, *Places & Spaces*: Mapping Science sought out and brought together the best examples of this kind of intellectual cartography. Each of the 100 maps in this collection represents the human desire to bring order and understanding to the complex forces that shape our existence. When we find ourselves adrift in a sea of information, these maps answer the questions that matter most: How big is this ocean? How can we navigate to the useful islands of knowledge? How is this knowledge interlinked on a global scale? In which areas is it worth investing precious time, effort, and resources? What lands should we explore next?

Drawing from across cultures and across scholarly disciplines, the science maps of *Places & Spaces* address these vital questions about the continuously evolving  contours and content of human knowledge. Created by leading expertsfigures in the natural, physical, and social sciences, scientometrics, visual arts, social and science policymaking, and the humanities, these maps allow us to better grasp the abstract contexts, relationships, and dynamism of human systems and collective intelligence. Individually and as a whole, they allow data to tell stories which both the scientist and the layperson can understand and appreciate.
