    Whether we like it or complain about it, bask in it or suffer from it, we
    all are affected by the weather. This essential truth becomes readily
    apparent when viewing _Earth_, the work of software engineer Cameron
    Beccario.  
      
    Using data from the Global Forecast System, _Earth_ visualizes worldwide
    weather patterns using animated wind streams, color coded according to
    velocity, that sweep across a three-dimensional globe. Truly interactive,
    the visualization allows the user to spin the globe and zoom in on a desired
    location. Tapping on that location will then bring up further information
    about exact coordinates, wind speed, and temperature, with all information
    updated every three hours.  
      
    The world itself may be seen from different perspectives, as the
    visualization offers nine different projections, such as conic equidistant,
    stereographic, or Waterman Butterfly. When Earth was first introduced in
    December 2013, it only visualized wind patterns. Since then, however,
    Beccario has increased the number of overlays to include such factors as
    carbon monoxide concentration, dust and sulfate extinction, along with the
    measured temperature. Earth also shows the perceived temperature which
    Beccario calls the Misery Index, borrowing a term from economics. Explore
