    At this point, everyone is familiar with coronaviruses. Many people also know about influenza (aka “the flu”), rabies, HIV, Zika, and Ebola. All of these are viruses: microscopic invaders that hijack the cellular machinery of living organisms. But what do these viruses have in common? And how are they different? Created by members of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and kapow, inc., the _Virus Explorer_ is a tool for learning more about these fascinating but harmful bugs. You can explore the similarities and differences among a variety of viruses by sorting them based on structure, genome type, host type, transmission mechanism, and vaccine availability. Each virus can also be further examined to investigate its size, structure (shown with both interactive 3D models and cross-section diagrams), replication cycle, and more.
