    You’ve probably heard of “machine learning,” but maybe you’re a little fuzzy
    on how it works. Not to worry—here’s a friendly introduction to machine
    learning that will give you the basics and beyond. It begins with a problem:
    How does a machine “learn” to tell one thing from another? From there, this
    scrollytelling tutorial takes us through the process in a way that is both
    informative and easy to follow. Machine learning algorithms are powerful
    tools in the field of artificial intelligence. This macroscope is a great
    first step in understanding how to put that power to use.
