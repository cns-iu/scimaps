  body: "Spain Lives in Flats by Raúl Sánchez and Analía Plaza begins with a
    relatively straightforward question: Why does Spain have the highest
    percentage of apartment dwellers in the European Union? As this work of
    scrollytelling journalism demonstrates, answering that question must take
    into account everything from 19th-century attitudes toward cholera and
    mid-20th-century periods of urban migration to Francoist-era city
    engineering, late-century housing bubbles, and a 21st-century pandemic. It
    also requires a staggering amount of data—in this case, cartographic data on
    more than 12 million buildings—to tell the story of Spain’s vertical
    urbanism. This wealth of data allows the analysis to move nimbly across
    scales, a movement that is reinforced by a visual narrative that hops from
    city to city, zooming in and out of urban areas to show how localized
    stories help explain larger national narratives. Towards the end, Spain
    Lives in Flats highlights models proposed by urban planning experts for
    building more sustainable futures—a move from diagnosis to potential cures
    that is the hallmark of solutions journalism."
