    _Nature 150_ is an interactive map of papers published in the journal Nature
    since its founding in 1869. Created by current and former members of the
    Barabási Lab at Northeastern University, the macroscope visualizes the
    journal’s publication history as a network of influence.

      

    Each node represents a published paper, and two paper nodes are connected if
    a third paper references them both. Nodes are color-coded by scientific
    discipline, showing how scientific works spread influence both within and
    beyond their disciplines. This network analysis shows that today’s
    scientific work draws upon and impacts a wider array of scientific fields
    than ever before. In other words, science is more interdisciplinary than it
    used to be.
