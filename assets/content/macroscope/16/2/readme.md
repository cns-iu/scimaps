    Watson News Explorer makes use of Watson Discovery News, which scans 300,000
    English-language news articles daily and uses natural language processing to
    convert them into a searchable network of topics. Natural language
    processing is a branch of artificial intelligence that combines linguistics
    with computing power. Natural language processing is at work in language
    translation apps, grammar checkers, and computerized personal assistants
    like Siri and Alexa. This macroscope, designed by Steven Ross, Timothy
    Stutts, Megan Monroe, and Mauro Martino of IBM’s Visual AI Lab, uses natural
    language processing to identify and link entities like names, locations,
    companies, and organizations.

      

    The macroscope offers four ways to dive into the news: a world map, a
    timeline, a word cloud, and a network. These visualizations are linked, so
    that searching in one will highlight connections in the others. You can also
    search for multiple keywords to reveal links that connect seemingly
    unrelated topics.
