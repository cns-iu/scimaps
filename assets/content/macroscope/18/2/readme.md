    Conceived and produced (or should we say “hatched”?) by *Science* senior
    podcast producer Sarah Crespi and UX designer Jia You, *Cracking the Mystery
    of Egg Shape* is a wonderful example of how “scrollytelling” can be used to
    convey scientific findings in an accurate and accessible way. Originally
    published in the journal *Science*, this work of data journalism follows
    researchers as they attempt to answer an age-old question: Why is there such
    variation in egg shape from bird to bird? Crespi and You take readers
    through the process of “doing science”: from asking questions to forming a
    hypothesis, from gathering data to conducting analysis and drawing
    conclusions. 


    To do this research, the team analyzed photographs of 49,175 bird eggs collected over the last 100 years and held by the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at Berkeley. They used a special computer program to collect egg measurements from the photographs. Moving visualizations provide a dynamic view of how various factors influence egg shape.
