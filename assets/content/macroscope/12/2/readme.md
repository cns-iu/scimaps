    The HathiTrust Digital Library is a collective “elephant’s memory” or
    storehouse of knowledge. Run by a consortium of international research
    libraries, it serves as a shared and growing repository for digital copies
    of more than 14 million publications that span 2000 years.  
      
    Visualization software developer David Reagan, curator Lisel Record, and
    information scientist Katy Bӧrner developed this visualization to delve into
    the geographic and temporal diversity of the collection using freely
    available metadata.  
      
    Yellow circles show publication locations, with the size of the circle
    showing how many publications were printed in that location. Lines connect
    publication locations to places where that language is spoken, illustrating
    the connection between publication location and potential readers.  
      
    If you look at publications from the years 1200-1400 you see the prominence
    of Persian science and culture reflected in the high number of publications
    from Iran and other Middle Eastern locations. If, on the other hand, you
    look at publications from the last 50 years, a colorful swirl of
    publications bubble up from many regions and flow to readers around the
    globe.
