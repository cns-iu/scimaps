Charles J. Minard (1781–1870) was a French civil engineer who liked to study streams and physics. In the course of his long career as an engineer, he took part in many prominent public works and the restoration of European canals, bridges, and roads after the Napoleonic Wars. Before his retirement, he published treatises on construction, including unique memoirs on partial routes, distances, traveling, and expenses. When he was nearly 65 years old, he began to publish cartes figuratives (figurative maps). Most of his early maps focused on the flow of goods and passengers along railroad, river, and sea routes of commerce. He used innovative techniques, such as pie charts, flow maps, and choropleth maps, to substitute mathematically proportioned images for dry and complicated columns of statistical data; as a result, a panoptic view became possible at first glance, and unprecedented comparisons could be made. By the early 1860s, at nearly 80 years of age, his interests shifted from economic phenomena to historical subjects, such as the movements of famous armies. In the last year of his life, he created the Carte figurative des pertes successives en hommes de l’Armée Française dans la campagne de Russie 1812–1813, also known as Napoleon’s March to Moscow.
