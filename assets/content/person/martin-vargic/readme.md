Martin Vargic is a Slovakian artist and graphic designer who took up making maps as a hobby in 2012. Since then, his work has received notice from major news outlets, and he has been quickly recognized as a significant talent in the world of mapmaking. In April 2013, Vargic started work on his first massive-scale map, Political Map of the World. Shortly thereafter, he embarked on the Map of the Internet, which he has been updating periodically. His latest work is the Map of Stereotypes, which, like his other maps, is available for viewing at http://www.halcyonmaps.com.
