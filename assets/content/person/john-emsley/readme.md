John Emsley is a chemist as well as an award-winning popular science writer and broadcaster. His books include Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements (Oxford University Press, 2003), Elements of Murder: A History of Poison (Oxford University Press, 2005), and Better Looking, Better Living, Better Loving (Wiley-VCH, 2007). He has written a comprehensive history of the periodic table of elements. The table was drawn by Robertson based on scientific data provided by Emsley. It was commissioned and supported by the Royal Society of Chemistry in the United Kingdom as part of an arts and science collaborative project called Visual Elements. The project aims to produce a new and vibrant visual assessment of the startling diversity of material that constitutes the world in which we live.
