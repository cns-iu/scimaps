Murray Robertson is an illustrator who has been involved with the visualization of ideas in science since 1998. As an artist and printmaker at Glasgow Print Studio, he exhibits regularly both within the United Kingdom and internationally. Robertson's works of graphic precision draw upon the iconography of signs and symbols inherent to the matrix of both mystical and scientific knowledge systems, echoing diverse cultures and empirical paradigms in an exploration of humanity's eternal and universal quest for knowledge and meaning. Projects have included working with Scottish Television (STV), the Medical Research Council, the UK Clinical Virology Network, and most recently the Electrical Engineering Department of Glasgow University, producing a series of images based on current developments in nanotechnology.
