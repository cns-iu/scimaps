André Skupin is an associate professor of geography at San Diego State University. Previously he held an associate professorship at the University of New Orleans. He received a master's degree in cartography at the Dresden University of Technology, Germany, and a doctoral degree in geography at the State University of New York at Buffalo. During his graduate studies he performed research at the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA). He has worked in the geographic information systems (GIS) industry in Germany, the United States, and South Africa. Skupin's core research area is the application of geographic metaphors, cartographic principles, and computational methods in the visualization of nongeographic information. His research is strongly interdisciplinary, aimed especially at increased cross-fertilization between geography, information science, and computer science. For example, he has developed new approaches to creating map-like knowledge domain visualizations on the basis of high-dimensional vector space models and artificial neural networks. Other recent work includes novel methods for visualizing individual human movement and demographic change as trajectories in n-dimensional attribute space. His research results have been published in such journals as IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, Computing in Science and Engineering, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Skupin has served as coeditor of a book on self-organizing maps, a special issue of Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design, and the 2007 U.S. National Report to the International Cartographic Association, which was published as a special issue of Cartography and Geographic Information Science.
