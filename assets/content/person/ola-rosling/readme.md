Ola Rosling is CEO & co-founder of Gapminder Foundation which he founded together with his father, Hans Rosling, and his wife, Anna Rosling Rönnlund. Since 1999, Ola lead the development of the Trendalyzer software, which was acquired by Google in 2007 where Anna and Ola turned it into the Google Motion Chart. As product manager for Google Public Data, Ola then democratized access to Public Statistics by integrating official statistical sources into Google Search results by introducing DSPL—Data Set Publishing Language. Ola then went back to Gapminder to develop free teaching materials. He initiated the Ignorance Project in 2013, to measure the widespread lack of knowledge of basic global facts.
