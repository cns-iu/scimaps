Claudius Ptolemy (circa AD 90–168) was a profoundly influential astronomer, astrologer, geographer, and mathematician. Also known as Claudius Ptolemaeus, Ptolomaeus, Klaudios Ptolemaios, and Ptolemeus, he lived and worked in Alexandria, Egypt. His curiosity about the dynamic relationships between celestial bodies and the causes and effects of climate led him to invent a longitude and latitude grid system to construct maps of the world. His mathematical proofs stating that the Earth is a sphere are still accepted today, in spite of the fact that he placed this sphere as a fixed point in the center of a universe that revolved around it daily. Ptolemy synthesized and extended Hipparchus’s system of epicycles and circles to develop a geocentric theory of the solar system. His theory required more than 80 epicycles to explain the motions of the sun, the moon, and the five planets known in his time. It is described in Mathematical Syntaxis—widely called the Almagest—a 13-book mathematical treatment of the phenomena of astronomy, providing a means of calculating positions. The Almagest included a star catalog of 48 constellations, listing the names we still use today. Ptolemy also made major contributions to the history of geography and cartography. Ptolemy’s is the first known projection of the sphere onto a plane. His geography remained the principal work on the subject until the work of Columbus.
