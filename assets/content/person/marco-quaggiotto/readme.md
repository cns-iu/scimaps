Marco Quaggiotto holds a PhD in industrial design and multimedia communication from Politecnico di Milano, Italyâ€”where he is now a researcher and teacher in communication design, working on interaction models for the exploration of geographic and abstract spaces. He also serves as a research scientist at the Complex Networks and Systems Lagrange Laboratory at the Institute for Scientific Interchange in Turin, working on the design of visual interfaces for real-life social and epidemic networks. The aim of his research is to extend the tools of cartography beyond the geographical space and to present the Atlas format as a narrative model able to intervene in complex, heterogeneous, dynamic realities. He developed an interface prototype for the exploration of research resources that allows users to manage bio-bibliographic resources in a shared environment and to access them through different maps and representations.
