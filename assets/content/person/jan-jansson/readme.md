Johannes Janssonius (1588â€“1664), more commonly known as Jan Jansson, is recognized today for having compiled and published the 17th-century Atlas Major. His father, Jan Janszoon the Elder, was a bookseller and publisher. In 1612, Jansson married the daughter of the cartographer Jodocus Hondius and set up business in Amsterdam as a book publisher. In 1616, he published his first maps of France and Italy, and he remained prolific thereafter. Jansson's maps closely resemble those of Willem Janszoon Blaeu and, in fact, were often copied from them. However, Jansson's maps, to many eyes, tend to be more flamboyant and decorative. From about 1630 to 1638, Jansson worked in partnership with his brother-in-law Henricus Hondius, issuing further editions of the Mercator/Hondius atlases to which his name was added. On the death of Henricus, he took over the business, expanding the work still further, until eventually he published the 11-volume Atlas Major.
