Ingo Günther, a sculptor and media artist, is a visiting professor at the Tokyo University of the Arts. He studied ethnology and cultural anthropology at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University (Frankfurt am Main) and art at the Düsseldorf Academy of Fine Arts, Germany. In the 1970s, his travels took him to Northern Africa, North and Central America, and Asia. Günther's early sculptural works with video led him toward more journalistic projects, which he pursued in TV, print, and art. Based in New York, he played a crucial role in the evaluation and interpretation of satellite data gathered from political and military crisis zones; the results were distributed internationally through print media and TV news. The goal was to make previously inaccessible military and ecological information available to the public in order to have a direct impact on political processes. Since 1988, Günther has used globes as a medium for his artistic and journalistic interests. In 1989, nine months before the unification of Germany, he founded the first independent TV station in Eastern Europe, Kanal X (Channel X), in Leipzig, in order to contribute to the establishment of a free media landscape. The interviews and research he conducted during a journey of several months through the Cambodian refugee camps in Thailand became the basis of a series of articles published in the German newspaper Die Tageszeitung (taz). This journey, and later travels to refugee camps around the world, became the foundation for Günther's concept of the Refugee Republic, on which he has been working ever since.
