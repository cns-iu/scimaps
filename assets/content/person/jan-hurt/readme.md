Jan Hurt has been a PhD candidate at the Complexity Science Hub since May 2021. He holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and a master’s degree in physics from the University of Vienna. In his master’s thesis, which he wrote at the CSH, Jan studied shock propagation on economic networks. In his current work he investigates how agent-based modeling can be used to support an evidence-based policy. Jan’s research interests range from statistical physics over agent-based modeling to environmental issues.
