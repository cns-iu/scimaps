Chris Harrison holds a BS and MA in computer science from New York University’s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. Since 2007, he has been a PhD student in the Human–Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Harrison has also interned at AT&T and Microsoft Research and worked as a research associate at Disney Research/Imagineering. His research interests primarily focus on mobile interaction techniques and input technologies, especially those that empower people to interact with small devices in big ways. He gets excited about large data sets and how, through computation, they can be given form via simple visual primitives that self-assemble into rich information tapestries.
