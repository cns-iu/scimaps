Bern Porter was a 20th century Renaissance man who made his mark on a number of disparate fields, a testament to his capacious intellect and his boundless curiosity. Soon after being trained in physics at Colby College and Brown University, Porter contributed to the development of the cathode ray tube. During World War II, Porter was involved with the Manhattan Project, working with researchers in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to separate highly enriched uranium for the purposes of creating nuclear weaponry. After the deployment of atomic weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Porter regretted his involvement in the project and became a committed pacifist. In the 1960s, Porter worked on NASA’s Saturn V manned rocket program. Along with his scientific achievements, Porter is also known as a significant figure among the literary avant-garde. His writing uses the material of popular culture (junk mail, instructional booklets, advertisements, etc.) to create an experimental poetics, what he called “Founds.”
