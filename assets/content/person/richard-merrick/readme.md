Richard Merrick holds a BS and an MS in city and regional planning from Clemson University, an MS in biological oceanography and an MS in marine resource management from Oregon State University, and a PhD in fisheries from the University of Washington. He joined NOAA Fisheries in 1985 as a marine mammal staff scientist at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center. In 1997, he transferred to the Northeast Fisheries Science Center, where he initially served as branch chief for protected species and then as chief of the Resource Evaluation and Assessment Division. While there, he directed the center’s assessment, ecological, and social-science research for fish and protected species and in the process created the map shown here. In 2011, Merrick began serving as chief science advisor and director of scientific programs. As the head of NOAA Fisheries’ scientific operations, he leads NOAA’s six regional Fisheries Science Centers, including 30 laboratories. He also spearheads the direct science efforts needed to support sustainable fisheries and ecosystems as well as to continue domestic progress in ending overfishing, rebuilding fish populations, saving critical species, and preserving vital habitats.
