Mathieu Bastian has an MS in computer science from the University of Technology of Compi√®gne, France. Proficient in Java, Swing, and OpenGL, he successfully led the 2007 to 2010 development of the Gephi project, an interactive network visualization platform that is recognized for its performance, usability, and extensible design. As a software architect, he was particularly interested in data visualization challenges, such as visualizing massive graph structures in real time. For two consecutive years, the project was selected for the Google Summer of Code program, during which Bastian mentored students while continuing his work on core development and documentation. In 2010, Bastian joined LinkedIn as a data scientist to build the next data-driven products, focusing on inferred identity, large graph analysis, and data visualization.
