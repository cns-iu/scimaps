Chris Creevey studied computer science, biology, and ecology before completing a PhD in bioinformatics at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth. As part of his postdoctoral research, he worked in the Bork Lab at EMBL, focusing on the quantification of gene-sharing events (horizontal gene transfer) in the tree of life. He is now a Stokes Lecturer at the Irish Agriculture and Food Development Authority (Teagasc), where his research group specializes in the use of next-generation genetic sequencing technologies to understand the interactions between digestive system microbial communities and their host with the aim of reducing the environmental impact of modern agricultural practices.
