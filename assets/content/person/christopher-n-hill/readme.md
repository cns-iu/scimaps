Chris Hill specializes in the application of large-scale computation to all aspects of understanding Earth and planetary systems. He is a founding developer of the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm), a numerical simulation tool used for a wide range of basic science and applied studies in planetary fluid dynamics. Hill also helped launch the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF), a major open standard for creating multicomponent models of Earth system processes. Among various projects, Hill co-leads the research, education, and outreach committee of the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC), a multi-university enterprise dedicated to enhancing large-scale computing infrastructure.
