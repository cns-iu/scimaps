Moritz Stefaner holds a BS in cognitive science from the University of Osnabrück, Germany, and an MA in interface design from the University of Applied Sciences in Potsdam, Germany. He works as a “truth and beauty operator” on the crossroads of data visualization, information aesthetics, and user-interface design. He is especially interested in the visualization of large-scale human activity, and his work beautifully balances the analytical and aesthetic aspects of mapping abstract and complex phenomena. In the past, he has helped clients such as the OECD, the World Economic Forum, Skype, Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA), Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), and the Max Planck Research Society to find insights and beauty in large data sets. In 2010, he was nominated for the Design Award of the Federal Republic of Germany, and his work has been exhibited at the Venice Architecture Biennale, SIGGRAPH, Ars Electronica, and the Max Planck Science Gallery. He is part of the advisory boards for the Places & Spaces exhibits and Prix Ars Electronica in the Digital Communities category. Stefaner serves as a reviewing expert for the Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) program of the European Commission. He has coauthored books published by O’Reilly Media, Springer, and others and has often spoken and lectured on the topic of information visualization. His personal portfolio is available at http://moritz.stefaner.eu, and he occasionally blogs at http://wellformed-data.net. Stefaner also publishes the Data Stories podcast together with Enrico Bertini.
