John N. Friedman is professor of economics and international and public affairs at Brown University and a founding co-director of Opportunity Insights at Harvard University. His research brings together theory and data, harnessing the power of large administrative datasets to yield policy-relevant insights on a wide range of topics, including taxation, healthcare, and education quality. His most well-known papers estimate the long-term effects of teachers on student outcomes such as college attendance and earnings; in just one year, a great teacher can raise the lifetime earnings of a single class of students by nearly $1.5 million. This work was cited by President Obama in his 2012 State of the Union Address. Friedman has also worked as special assistant to the President for economic policy at the [National Economic Council](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/administration/eop/nec) in the White House from 2013-2014. He holds a Ph.D. in economics, an AM in statistics, and a BA in economics, all from Harvard University. He is a Research Associate at the [National Bureau of Economic Research](http://admin.nber.org/people/john_friedman).
