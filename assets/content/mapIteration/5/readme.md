title: Science Maps for Science Policy Makers
---
This iteration shows science maps for science policy-makers as well as citizens interested in understanding national priorities, spending, and achievements. Featured are two early maps, two maps of observation and sensor data, and six maps of scholarly data. The maps communicate:

*   The steady increase of scientists in the total population, versus a decline of R&D investment as a fraction of GNP.
*   Categories for evaluating and comparing evolving scientific collaboration.
*   Needed changes in the Boston Traffic Separation Scheme to reduce the risk of ships striking whales.
*   Urban mobility patterns to improve the design and management of cities.
*   The U.S. federal discretionary budget.
*   Return on investment for U.S. chemistry R&D including a timeline and investment cycles.
*   Funding portfolios of the National Institutes of Health.
*   The structure of science based on download (rather than publication) activity.
*   Research leadership of the U.S. compared with the top-12 competitive nations.
*   Progress towards the Millennium Development Goals to be achieved by 2015.
