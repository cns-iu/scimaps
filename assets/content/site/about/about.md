overviewParagraph: "Drawing from across cultures and across scholarly
  disciplines, *Places & Spaces: Mapping Science* demonstrates the power of maps
  to address vital questions about the contours and content of human knowledge.
  An interdisciplinary and international advisory board chose each one of the
  works in the *Places & Spaces: Mapping Science* exhibit as an outstanding
  example of how visualization can bring patterns in scientific data into focus.
  The exhibit is curated by the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center
  at Indiana University. The exhibit has been on display at over 382 venues in
  28 countries on 6 continents. It showcases the work of 248 mapmakers that hail
  from 17 different countries"

curatorsDescription: The *Places & Spaces* exhibit is curated by
  the [Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center](http://cns.iu.edu/) at
  Indiana University. CNS's mission is to advance datasets, tools, and services
  for the study of biomedical, social and behavioral science, physics, and other
  networks. A specific focus is research on the structure and evolution of
  science and technology (S&T) and the communication of results via static and
  interactive maps of science. The Center's administrative home is in Luddy Hall
  at the [Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and
  Engineering](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html), Indiana University,
  Bloomington, Indiana, USA.
advisoryBoardDescription: The pieces that make up the *Places & Spaces* exhibit
  are chosen annually in a process that begins with a call for submissions.
  Then, the team of international reviewers and exhibit advisors shown below
  work with the Indiana University exhibit team to select the most insightful
  and innovative submissions. The Indiana University exhibit team benefits
  greatly from the expert input it receives from this international advisory
  board.
ambassadorsDescription: These men and women from around the globe work
  selflessly to make the exhibit a success. Their intellectual guidance and
  commitment to promoting science mapping are what has made *Places &
  Spaces* the vital exhibit it is today. Those whom are also members of
  the Advisory Board not only work to build public awareness of the exhibit, but
  also participate in the map selection process.
