      The *Places & Spaces: Mapping Science* exhibit is designed to open
      people’s minds and hearts to the value, complexity, and beauty of science
      and technology. We are inviting authors of interactive data
      visualizations, also called macroscopes, to submit their work for
      inclusion in the *Places & Spaces: Mapping Science* exhibit.


      This collection of interactive visualizations will provide a glimpse into the future: a time when larger and more complex datasets are available, multi-factor analysis becomes commonplace, user interfaces are easier to use, and interactive visualizations routinely facilitate creative problem solving. Perhaps they incorporate datasets or methods of analysis from multiple disciplines. Or perhaps they demonstrate what kind of societal impact is made possible by influential interactive visualizations. Show us the future of interactive visualizations by submitting your work to this final iteration of macroscopes in the *Places & Spaces: Mapping Science* exhibit. 


      Macroscopes are software tools that help us focus on patterns in data that are too large or complex to see with the naked eye. The term “macroscope” was explored in 1979 by Joël de Rosnay in a book titled *The Macroscope: A New World Scientific System* \[1]. To meet the challenges posed by the rapidly increasing abundance, diversity, and complexity of information, de Rosnay proposes the “macroscope,” a tool for observing “what is at once too great, too slow, and too complex for our eyes.”


      *Places & Spaces* is a traveling exhibit that currently features 100 maps and 36 interactive macroscopes from a wide range of disciplines. Since 2005, the exhibit has traveled to 30 countries and appeared in various formats at over 458 venues and events, including the Davos Economic Forum, National Academy of Sciences, and the New York Public Library. News coverage has appeared in *Nature*, *Science*, *USA Today*, and *Wired*.

      Interactive data visualizations designed for desktop, mobile,
      touch-enabled, and/or large (e.g., tiled wall) devices are all welcome. To
      be incorporated into our exhibit kiosk, macroscopes must be 1) web-based,
      2) touch-enabled, 3) allowed to run inside an iframe element, 4) have CORS
      enabled for <http://idemo.cns.iu.edu/macroscope-kiosk/#/>, and 5) served
      over HTTPS. Macroscopes will be deployed on a 46” multi-touch display
      running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Chrome 91. Each macroscope should be fully
      functional for at least two years. Macroscopes might be deployed using
      other hardware; please contact the curatorial team to discuss options.
      Macroscope authors should be available to work with the exhibit staff over
      a period of three months to prepare the macroscopes for public display and
      travel.


      Each entry must be submitted by January 15, 2024, and needs to include:


      * Title of macroscope

      * Author(s) name, email address, affiliation, mailing address

      * Link to online site that features the macroscope tool or to executable code

      * Macroscope tool description (300 words max): user group and needs served, data used, data analysis performed, visualization techniques applied, and main insights gained

      * References to relevant publications or online sites that should be cited, links to related projects or works

      * Describe the impact your data visualization has had on public awareness, social policy, or political action

      * Submit entries via the following link: <https://forms.gle/rNqq6nDG8YfvNg3MA>
  - header: Review Process
    content: >-
      Submissions will be reviewed and evaluated by the exhibit advisory board
      (listed below) in terms of their:


      * Scientific rigor

      * Value as a tool for data exploration

      * Ability to provide new, actionable insights

      * Relevance for a general audience


      Please feel free to send any questions you might have regarding the judging process to Todd Theriault (ttheriau@indiana.edu) and use the subject heading “Macroscope Inquiry.”
  - header: Final Submission
    content: >-
      Authors of winning entries will be contacted by February 15, 2024 and
      invited to submit final entries by May April 1, 2024. Each final entry
      consists of:


      * Link to online site that features the macroscope tool or link to executable code. This must be a fully self-contained version of the macroscope that can operate without any outside links and without opening new windows.

      * Biographies for all authors (100 words each)

      * High resolution author portraits that are no smaller than 360 x 450 pixels, or 1.2” x 1.5” at 300 dpi.

      * Signed copyright and reproduction agreement


      Authors are welcome to use the expertise and resources of the exhibit curators and designers. The macroscopes are expected to be ready for display in late May of 2024.
