By Naval Pandey, Research Assistant, Red Pill Blue Pill VR team, CNS



We at the Red Pill Blue Pill team, spearhead CNS’s research endeavors to leverage Virtual Reality (VR) to expand the domains of data visualization. Immediately after joining the team, one of my first tasks was to explore different metaverses and find opportunities for CNS to stake a claim to its own space. What is a metaverse? First presented in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 novel Snow Crash (Stephenson, 1992), the term has reached mainstream recognition through Meta’s (formerly Facebook) embracing of metaverse-related technologies, most notably, VR. 



The latest definition of the metaverse is “a digital reality that combines aspects of social media, online gaming, and cryptocurrencies to allow users to interact virtually” (Velasquez, 2021). Today, the metaverse is fast expanding to a multi-platform virtual space, leveraging multiple extended reality technologies, not just virtual reality.



For our own metaverse, we settled on an application called AltSpace VR. It is a leading VR platform acquired by Microsoft in 2017, and offers us the most flexibility to modify our content in the future. AltSpace VR also has a Unity (video game and 3D engine) [plugin](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/altspace-vr/world-building/world-building-toolkit-getting-started), which fitswell with our workflow since we perform most of our VR development in Unity. Our CNS metaverse currently hosts a virtual gallery, with the “[Science Maps for Kids](https://scimaps.org/maps)” exhibits on display. In the future, we plan to expand the gallery to host many more exhibits. The nature of exhibits does not need to be limited to images as we can also display videos and 3D assets in our virtual gallery.



The CNS metaverse gallery is more than just an exhibition space, however. It can also be a place of social engagements. We have the ability to assign speakers, who can use presentation tools like a virtual screen to show their material. We can also hold guided tours to present the works on display with our peers. The exhibits can also be designed to be interactable for a more engaging user experience.



Anyone can access our space in the metaverse, it's free! And no, you do not even need a VR headset to see it (though it is a lot more fun if you have one). You can download the application on your PC or mac. A link to a detailed step by step guide is published below. Just follow the steps in the guides to get started!
