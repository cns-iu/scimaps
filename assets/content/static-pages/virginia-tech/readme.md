Places & Spaces at Virginia Tech
================================

August 21 - November 22, 2017
-----------------------------

Beginning August 21, 2017, Virginia Tech will feature the _Places & Spaces: Mapping Science_ exhibition, which makes a beautiful case for the importance of data visualization.  
  
The _Places & Spaces_ exhibition showcases the visualization of complex data in innovative and beautiful formats, using groundbreaking methods for making sense of large streams of data. Each year new visualizations are added, culled from international and interdisciplinary submissions. Four new macroscopes have been chosen to travel with the exhibition, and will make their debut at Virginia Tech.  
  
These new macroscopes are especially good at conveying a sense of scale and navigating through data at different scales. They include some of the largest data sets imaginable, like the cosmos and the history of the world. Yet, they also let you focus on individual details like the most important paper in one scientist's career.  
  
The macroscopes will join the 100 maps of science, sculpture, and hands on activities that currently comprise the exhibition. The exhibition will be on display in the [Newman Library](https://www.vt.edu/about/buildings/newman-library.html).
