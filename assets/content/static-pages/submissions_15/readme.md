### Abstract:

The Quest Diagnostics Drug Testing Index™ (DTI) examines the results of more than 10 million workforce drug tests performed at Quest Diagnostics. The test results are organized according to three categories of workers: federally-mandated, safety-sensitive workers; the general workforce; and the combined U.S. workforce. Federally-mandated, safety-sensitive workers include pilots, bus and truck drivers, and workers in nuclear power plants, for whom routine drug testing is mandated by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 2018 marks thirty consecutive years of the Quest Diagnostics Drug Testing Index™ (DTI), an analysis of national workplace drug positivity trends based on the company's de-identified laboratory data. The DTI has revealed insights into drug use in the United States since the Drug-Free Workplace Act was signed into law in 1988.

The DTI Drug Map specifically shows urine drug test positivity by 3-digit zip code in the United States. The analysis can be viewed by substance type and year going back to 2017. It juxtaposes these local positivity rates and trends against national positivity rates and trends.

Strengths of the Drug Testing Index analysis include its large, nationally representative sample size, longitudinal monitoring, a testing population that is generally reflective of the U.S. workforce and the quality of the company's drug testing services to confirm positive results. Limitations include analysis only of employers that perform drug testing with the company and a lack of exact cross-specimen comparisons due to variations in substances for which employers test. Quest Diagnostics publishes the findings as a public service.

### Abstract:

This visualization displayed how the wealth distributes in the United States. I used the median household income data from 2012-2016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates. One circle is one county, the scale of circle and color indicated the amount of median household income. From this visualization, readers are able to compare the income level across states and within a state. Some states have many counties in yellow, meaning that more counties in these states are relatively wealthy. If the state has most of the counties in blue, then this state is a relatively poor state. By changing the views, readers can arrange states by geographical position as well as in the order of a state's income gap (from the lowest-income county to the highest-income county).

3\. Politoscope - the life of political communities through the lens of social media

### Abstract:

As well as political parties, which use big data coming from social networks to analyze the opinions of their fellow citizens, the Politoscope puts research tools at the disposal of citizens to analyze the speeches and opinions of political figures and their communities. This political macroscope was designed for the 2017 French presidential election. Available online as well as on display at the 9 months TERRA DATA exhibition at the Cité des Sciences et de l’Industrie, it gaves in real-time, during the last month of the presidential campaign, the pulse of the online political communities of the main candidates running for the election, as well as the reconstruction, over several months, of their positions on major political issues. Through the analysis of dozens of millions of political and media tweets, the Politoscope makes it possible to visualize the socio-semantic trends of a multi-polar political environment and dive into the debates of the political communities as well as the main verbatims of their leaders. It relies on a new methodology described in Noe Gaumont, Maziyar Panahi, David Chavalarias (forthcoming 2017) Reconstruction of the socio-semantic dynamics of political activist Twitter networks – Method and application to the 2017 French Presidential election The Politoscope was probably one of the first initiative to offer citizens of an entire country the opportunity to follow in real time the tribulations of political parties and their militant base from massive Twitter data (see https://presidentielle2017.politoscope.org/dashboard). After the intensive use of this type of data by political parties to screen the views of their citizens, we are convinced that these researches and associated projects will be part of the future rebalancing of information between political elites and citizens in social contexts as sensitive to our democracies as elections.

We are convinced that this kind of macroscope is necessary to raise awarness on today entanglement between social networks and electoral processes worldwide.

### Abstract:

The key aim of Scholar Plot (SP) \[1\] is to complement the conventional academic CV, aiding and streamlining its insightful interpretation for promotion and tenure (P&T) evaluation. Additional aims of SP are packaging academic profiles into pictorial forms for broader consumption and scaling-up P&T criteria to groups of scholars.

In support of P&T evaluation, SP depicts synergistically in a temporal plot the interaction of funding with the production of quality and impactful research over the course of a faculty’s career. Research quality and impact are quantified via the impact factor (IF) of journals and paper citations, respectively. For broad consumption, the time series aspect of SP’s synergistic plot collapses into three summative entities, which guide the construction of a flower metaphor. The said flower is a coded pictorial description of a faculty’s overall academic merit: its leaves correspond to levels of funding; its rounds of petals correspond to publication quality, as expressed by IF; the layers of pollinators the flower attracts correspond to accrued citations.

To support fair appraisal, the plot and pictorial forms of SP are normalized to remove disciplinary and chronological biases \[2\]. SP's forms are also scalable, representing equally well individual scholars and their academic units, thus contributing to consistent ranking practices across the university organizational structure. Specifically, the plot form is used to represent both faculty and their departments, with the latter being treated as composite scholars. In the pictorial form, departments are represented as collection of flowers, akin to academic gardens.

SP draws from faculty lists in U.S. universities, as well as funding (NIH/NSF RePORTER tables), bibliometric (Google Scholar), and journal IF (Thompson Reuters Journal Citations Report) data.

### Abstract:

This project explores the ways in which green roofs can be used to counteract three major urban ecological challenges in New York City. Taking the city’s existing infrastructural landscape as the starting point, this visualization moves to identify underutilized spaces where green roofs would be most amenable and beneficial from the perspective of (1) stormwater retention, (2) surface temperature regulation, and (3) biodiversity enhancement. Users will then be given opportunities to explore the data themselves and engage with questions regarding the aggregative effects, and benefits of such interventions. Ultimately the goal of this project is to provide creative ways of interacting with the New York City 'building-scape' in order to foster community engagement and informed decision making for residents and policy-makers alike.

### Abstract:

CHICAGO – June 5, 2014 – The jobs recovery has put spotlights on two large sections of the labor force: workers nearing the end of their careers and young adults just beginning them. While the economy has been difficult for both groups, baby boomers now hold a larger percentage of jobs in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and other occupations than before the recession, while millennials have generally struggled to make headway four years into the recovery.

The number of jobs held by baby boomers (age 55-64) grew 9 percent from 2007 to 2013, a gain of 1.9 million. The millennial workforce (age 22-34), however, has not recovered from the recession nearly as fast. With an increase of only 110,000 jobs, employment in 2013 was essentially unchanged from 2007 (.3 percent growth).

7\. Reorderable Matrices

### Abstract:

The reorderable matrix is a physical device developed in the mid 1960s by French cartographer Jacques Bertin for exploring and presenting tabular data.

Bertin designed several reorderable physical matrices he called Dominos, each with a different size and visual encoding. The first three images above show a small, medium, and large version. A rod mechanism allowed unlocking either rows or columns for reordering.

The dominos were part of a general method of “graphic information processing”, extensively described by Bertin in a relatively poorly-known 1977 book. This method stems from his progressive realization that, while maps and charts are traditionally drawn once for all, “mobile images” can be freely manipulated to reveal patterns. Thus he recognized the importance of interactivity three decades before information visualization. Bertin physically implemented five types of “interactive” visualizations:

*   the family of curves (line charts on transparent paper sheets that can be superimposed)
*   the image file (stacked cards with a visual index)
*   the collection of maps (rearrangeable small multiples)
*   the collection of ordered tables (rearrangeable paper tables), and finally
*   the reorderable matrix.

For Bertin, the reorderable matrix was by far the most powerful tool. His method required that numerical data be collected on a paper table to start with. Then, values were converted into discrete steps, again on a paper table (7 to 11 different steps depending on the Domino version). Then, the physical matrix was assembled by choosing among a collection of physical cells that encode different ranges of values. Afterwards, the matrix was reordered to reveal patterns, which could take a long time. Finally, meaningful groups were identified and named. The result was then photographied or photocopied, and the final image was used as a figure in the scientific publication, enriched with a legend and caption.

The first video (fourth image above) shows a reorderable matrix being used. The second video is an educational video explaing the method to a large audience (English subtitles are available). Bertin's method of data analysis, while time-consuming, remained popular for a while and underwent several computer adaptations.

### Abstract:

Skill shortages are costly and can hamper growth, but we don't currently measure these shortages in a detailed or timely way. To address this challenge, we have developed the first data-driven skills taxonomy for the UK that is publicly available. A skills taxonomy provides a consistent way of measuring the demand and supply of skills. It can also help workers and students learn more about the skills that they need, and the value of those skills.

### Abstract:

Exploratorium is a web page with several interactive concept lattices that represent the ontologi- cal knowledge from the set-semantic view of space-time theories. Contexts were build up from known theoretical reconstructions of space-time and gravitational theories. Here I present readings of the networks, using the set-semantic, structuralist approach of philosophy of science. This is done as such since the lattices reflect hierarchical properties of scientific knowl- edge, classes of models, specialization and theorization relations that serve to clarify differences between theories. It includes a holon of theories, a bigger network formed as all the contexts are joined. The on line interac- tive version shows common concepts when highlighting features and tags giving extra information on the side.

### Abstract:

Refugee Flow uses compelling visual design with comprehensive data to humanize the perilous transformation of the refugee.

_What is Refugee Flow?_

Is an exploratory investigation of the migration crisis. Combining multiple datasets and interactive visualizations, the project aims to allow users to create a better understanding of the current crisis.

_How can design and technology help find solutions in migration?_

Building solutions for the migration crisis requires political will, which must be driven by society. We are continually presented with facts and figures of the lingering refugee crisis but are unmoved. Our idea is to present this data in new, interesting, and visually appealing ways. Facts inform us, but they don’t push us to act. Emotion gets people to act. Refugee Flow aims to merge design and technology to help better understand the migration crisis in a way that resonates with users. We hope this inspires better solutions.

_Why is Refugee Flow important?_

Currently, UNHCR reports that 68.5 million people are forcibly displaced around the world. Funding to tackle the current challenge is decreasing, not increasing. By 2050 the continued impact of climate change will forcibly displace 1 billion people. The crisis is getting worse, not better. We must gain a greater understanding and we need to figure out better solutions to this crisis. Refugee Flow is a call to this action.
