This iteration explores the utility of science maps for scholars and answers questions such as:

*   Who are our ancestors, and how are we related to other species?
*   How do human brain regions interlink and impact our thoughts and behaviors?
*   What drugs target what diseases, and how do disease phenotypes interact?
*   How do children learn language in complex social environments, and how can language disorders be treated?
*   What communities and interdisciplinary connections exist across the field of media art?
*   How are scholars linked to texts, people, projects, events, their relationships, as well as personal comments?
*   Which literary writers used what temporal and spatial settings in Victorian poetry?
*   How do multiple scientific specialties merge to form a new area of science?
*   How do scientists weave the fabric of science via collaborations and citations?
*   Where are the academic jobs?
