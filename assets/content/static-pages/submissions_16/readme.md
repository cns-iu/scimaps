### Abstract:

Migration-driven diversification is one of the key processes that defines our times. Over the past few decades, multiple causes and categories of migration‚ combined with migrants‚ shifting origins and traits‚ have been transforming urban populations in complex ways, worldwide. Such trends are producing conditions of what is now often called superdiversity. New ground-breaking, interactive data visualization tools show us how this process unfolds. Working with a team of international scholars and national statistical institutes, Germany‚ Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity has released a unique set of online, interactive data visualization tools. The website allows viewers (policymakers, researcher, students, civil servants, NGOs and the general public) to explore various combinations of migrant characteristics -- such as nationality, gender, age, education and legal status‚ and their effects. The viewer can choose to see a range of migration and diversity variables on various scales and across time periods. They can also explore data comparatively across three contexts: Canada (Vancouver), Australia (Sydney) and New Zealand (Auckland).  
The interactive data visualizations include:  

*   stacked area charts depicting permanent immigration by admission category;
*   treemaps of data by region and country of immigrant origin;
*   Sankey diagrams of religious and ethnic diversity at the metropolitan scale;
*   multi-dimensional maps based on indices of different types of diversity;
*   bubble graphics showing relationships between cultural diversity and socio-economic outcomes; and
*   dashboard visualizations that enable viewers to consider socio-economic outcomes associated with an imaginary individual, through selecting that person‚ age, gender, ethnicity and immigration history.

  
The tools have been produced by a leading team of migration scholars including Prof. Steve Vertovec (Max Planck Institute), Prof. Dan Hiebert (University of British Columbia), Prof. Alan Gamlen (Monash University) and Prof. Paul Spoonley (Massey University) in collaboration with Stamen Design and the Immersive Visualization Platform at Monash University.

### Abstract:

Ever wondered what makes different countries similar? We've explored that question through the lens of machine learning and created an interactive data-driven map where countries are organized by various indicators like Health Expenditure, Unemployment Rate, Control of Corruption, and many others. The map is also a playground where you can run various experiments‚ try to improve life in a separate country by raising the level of health care and GDP, and see how its position on the map changes.

3\. Cuentalo: A Constellation of Horrors
========================================

### Abstract:

#Cuentalo was a social media viral phenomenon, with tens of thousands of women openly telling their own experiences of sexual harassment and violence--many for the first time in their lives. We performed a statistical analysis of the first 2.6 million tweets of the event, revealing some details about the profiles of women who tweeted, and most importantly what they talked about in the tweets. We used the manual analysis to train algorithms to read all the tweets in the movement. We used this information to create an interactive visualization of the movement: one dot per tweet, scaled by retweets, positioned by closeness to the movement (original story in first or third person, expression of support or emotion, and others), and colored by the likeliness that the tweet mentions physical violence. The visualization is designed to show global characteristics of the movement, transmitting a sense of its scale and motivations while keeping the individuality of each personal story.

### Author(s):

Xavi Giménez and Francesco Massucci

### Abstract:

A web-based interactive visual essay depicting how the R&I projects developed under the EU Framework Programmes (FP7 and H2020) are contributing to the Societal Developments Goals, by mapping Science efforts onto SDGs using NLP techniques and analyzing the results. The methodology maps textual information of research onto the first 16 SDGs.  
  
The tool is an application of the cited methodology, as we have classified the abstract of all research and innovation projects financed by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme (FP7) and Horizon 2020 (H2020) and developed a set of interactive visualizations, supported by data storytelling techniques in order to provide insights and to guide users at discovering the data.

### Abstract:

Freshwater has been described as the oil of the 21st century \[1\]. In the wake of extreme water stress events across the globe in places like Cape Town, Mexico City, and Australia, I wanted to take a look at water issues here at home in the United States. Major factors like population growth and climate change are causing localized regional pockets of water stress that will soon affect other areas of the country without action. In order to change our relationship with water, action must come in the form of both infrastructure investments and behavioral changes.

### Abstract:

Cities have many factors that need measuring, like air pollution, weather, traffic patterns and road quality. By attaching inexpensive sensors to crowd-sourced urban vehicles, we can capture hyper-local measurements across a large portion of a city.  
  
How many vehicles would be required to adequately scan a city? In this project, we show that the sensing power of taxi fleets is unexpectedly large. Just 10 taxis typically cover one-third of Manhattan’s streets in one day—and the sensing power of taxis is very similar across cities around the world.

8\. Artificial Nature
=====================

### Author(s):

Haru Ji and Graham Wakefield

### Abstract:

Artificial Nature is an installation series and research project by Haru Ji (South Korea) and Graham Wakefield (UK), creating a family of interactive art installations surrounding humans with biologically-inspired complex systems experienced in immersive mixed reality. The invitation is to become part of an alien ecosystem rich in networks of complex feedback, but not as its central subject. Although artificial natures are computational, we draw our inspiration from the sense of open-ended continuation and the aesthetic integration of playful wonder with the tension of the unfamiliar recalled from childhood explorations in nature. By giving life to mixed reality we’re anticipating futures inevitably saturated in interconnected computational media. However we believe computation is not intrinsically utilitarian, nor in opposition to nature; we see it instead as a material means to plunge even more deeply into what nature is, and find our place within it. It comes from an inherent curiosity and aesthetic survival instinct to narrate alternate worlds in superposition to us, as a reminder that although the imaginable is greater than the known, the real is greater and weirder still.

### Abstract:

In recent years refugee immigration across Europe has often been presented and understood as a single, momentous wave. To what extent is this true? How does the number of refugees compare to the number of citizens in each European country, and where did they come from?

Nathan Yau

### Abstract:

We looked at shifts in job distribution over the past several decades, but it was difficult to see by how much each occupation group changed individually. The chart below makes the changes more obvious. For example, computer and math jobs went from relative nothing to a +544% explosion since 1970.

### Abstract:

How knowledge informs and alters disciplines is itself an enlightening, and vibrant field. This type of meta research into new findings, insights, conceptual frameworks and techniques is important, among other things, for policymakers who fund research in the hope of tackling society’s most pressing challenges, which inevitably span disciplines.  
  
Since its founding in 1869, Nature has offered a venue for publishing major advances from many fields. To mark its anniversary, we track here how papers cite and are cited across disciplines, using data on tens of millions of scientific articles indexed in Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science (WoS), a bibliometric database that encompasses many thousands of research journals starting from 1900. We pay particular attention to articles that appeared in Nature. In our view, this snapshot, for all its idiosyncrasies, reveals how scientific work is ever more becoming a mixture of disciplines.

### Abstract:

Economic inequality isn't just limited to neighborhoods. The restaurants, stores, and other places we visit in cities are all unequal in their own way.  
  
The Atlas of Inequality shows the income inequality of people who visit different places in cities around the U.S. It uses aggregated anonymous location data from digital devices to estimate people's incomes and where they spend their time.  
  
Using that data, we've made our own place inequality metric to capture how unequal the incomes of visitors to each place are. Economic inequality isn't just limited to neighborhoods, it's part of the places you visit every day.

### Abstract:

For ‘The Room of Change’ we created a 30-meters-long hand-crafted data-tapestry illustrating how multiple aspects of our environment have changed in the past centuries, how they are still changing, and how they will likely continue changing, addressing many of the topics presented in the exhibition.  
  
Combining several different data sources depicting the world from both global and local-individual perspectives, the installation tells stories of people and their relationship with what has been around them over time, layering dense and granular information within the narration to highlight how change is pervasive at all scales.
