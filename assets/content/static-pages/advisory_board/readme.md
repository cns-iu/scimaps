Advisory Board
==============

The pieces that make up the _Places & Spaces_ exhibit are chosen annually in a process that begins with a call for submissions. Then, the team of international reviewers and exhibit advisors shown below work with the Indiana University exhibit team to select the most stunning and innovative submissions. The Indiana University exhibit team benefits greatly from the expert input it receives from this international advisory board.
