Exhibit Team
============

The _Places & Spaces_ exhibit is curated by the [Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center](http://cns.iu.edu) at Indiana University. CNS's mission is to advance datasets, tools, and services for the study of biomedical, social and behavioral science, physics, and other networks. A specific focus is research on the structure and evolution of science and technology (S&T) and the communication of results via static and interactive maps of science.  
  
The Center's administrative home is in Luddy Hall at the [School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering](http://soic.iu.edu/ "School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University"), Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, USA.
