_Atlas of Science_, based on the popular exhibit _Places & Spaces: Mapping Science_, describes and displays successful mapping techniques. The heart of the book is a visual feast: Claudius Ptolemy's _Cosmographia World Map_ from 1482; a guide to a PhD thesis that resembles a subway map; "the structure of science" as revealed in a map of citation relationships in papers published in 2002; a periodic table; and many more. Each entry includes the story behind the map and biographies of its makers.  
  
_“Science is a voyage of discovery and Katy Börner has provided its first atlas. This excellent book offers a compendium of all that is best in explaining visual maps of our scientific knowledge.”_  
—Michael Batty, University College London

In an age of information overload, the ability to make sense of vast amounts of data and to render insightful visualizations is as important as the ability to read and write. The _Atlas of Knowledge_ explains and exemplifies the power of visualizations not only to help locate us in physical space but also to help us understand the extent and structure of our collective knowledge, to identify bursts of activity, pathways of ideas, and borders that beg to be crossed.  
  
_“Finally, visualization reaches maturity as Katy Börner shows readers the powerful, but rarely seen, forces that shape our lives. Drawing on the work of thousands of creative visual designers, this book is a tribute to human ingenuity in creating our new world of visual thinking.”_  
—Ben Shneiderman, University of Maryland, author of _Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction_
