How Mauro Martino uses dots and arcs to tell stories about culture
------------------------------------------------------------------

Data visualization expert Mauro Martino walks us through Charting Culture (2014), an animation he co-created with Maximillian Schich. It is one of Natureâ€™s most popular videos. Martino explains how tracking where people are born and where they die can reveal migration patterns, show rising and falling fortunes of cultural centers, and reflect changes in transportation.
