AcademyScope
============

  

### Website(s):

[http://www.nap.edu/academy-scope](http://www.nap.edu/academy-scope)  

### Author(s):

Stephen Mautner and Katy Börner

### Abstract:

_AcademyScope_ is an interactive visualization offering viewers a means to explore all reports published by the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, National Academy of Medicine, and National Research Council—from twenty years ago to today. In addition to showing report downloads around the world in real time, this discovery tool allows viewers to browse reports by topic and subtopic, see the relatedness of reports via elaborate networks of book covers dynamically displayed on the screen, and access detailed information about individual reports.

_AcademyScope_ is the product of a collaboration between the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and Indiana University’s Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science (CNS) Center. The original conception and creation of the visualization—as initially intended for display and interactive use on a 55-inch touchscreen monitor to be housed in the East Gallery of the National Academy of Sciences Building on Constitution Avenue in Washington, DC (the “kiosk version”)—was the work of two teams:

NAS team: Stephen Mautner, Barbara Kline Pope, Alphonse MacDonald, and JD Talasek  
CNS team: Chin Hua Kong, Adam Simpson, Samuel Mills, and Katy Börner

Subsequent adaptation of the kiosk version of the visualization to an online version was the work of Juan Thomassie and Jeff Colosino.

### Quotes from Reviewers:

"Academy Scope provided a highly informative video of the various features of the macroscope. The data visualization elements are extraordinarily strong, as are the interactive features involving touch screen capabilities. Good use of mathematical algorithms. The macroscope enables in-depth exploration of publications and their relationships, which makes it highly useful as well as fun."

"Very clear and dramatic visualization Brings what would otherwise be a pretty dry topic to life."

"Dynamic way to understand a body of literature.Great touchscreen functionality! Great exemplar of interactivity."

HubCab: Exploring New York City taxi trails and sharing our way to a more sustainable urban future
==================================================================================================

### Website(s):

### Author(s):

### Abstract:

With an ever-increasing trove of real-time urban data streams, we are able to see precisely where, how, and at what times different parts of our cities become stitched together as hubs of mobility. By using these pervasive, interconnected, and "smart" technologies, we can begin to unravel the complexity of our travel patterns and identify how we can reduce the social and environmental costs embedded in our transportation systems. In HubCab we target taxicab services as a way to understand the linkages between our travel habits and the places we travel to and from most often.

HubCab is an interactive visualization that invites you to explore the ways in which over 170 million taxi trips connect the City of New York in a given year. This interface provides a unique insight into the inner workings of the city from the previously invisible perspective of the taxi system with a never before seen granularity. HubCab allows to investigate exactly how and when taxis pick up or drop off individuals and to identify zones of condensed pickup and dropoff activities. It allows you to navigate to the places where your taxi trips start and end and to discover how many other people in your area follow the same travel patterns. What do these visualizations tell us about collective mobility? How many of these cabs might you have been able to share with the people around you? And how might entertaining these questions be the first step in building a more efficient and cheaper taxi service?

The HubCab tool expands and changes the perception of urban space using a large-scale data set. Studying this data, we show in a scientific study \[1\] the vast potential of taxi shareability. Our analysis introduces the novel concept of "shareability networks" that allows for efficient modeling and optimization of the trip-sharing opportunities. This mathematical approach makes use of network densification effects and represents a substantial advance over the existing state-of-the-art solutions to social sharing problems. Significant improvements of such a shared system are expected to lead to less congestion in road traffic, less running costs and split fares, and to a less polluted, cleaner environment \[2\].

The sharing benefits displayed on the map refer to total fare fare savings to passengers, distance distance savings in travelled miles, and co2 emission savings in kg of CO2 that come from potentially shared trips. Our research \[1\] shows that taxi sharing could reduce the number of trips by 40% with only minimal inconvenience to the passengers. Here we assume this 40% shareability rate, together with the following highly simplifying assumptions: A fare of 3.00$ + 2.50$/mi \[3\], using Rate Code 1 not accounting for low motion fares or special surcharges, and average CO2 emissions of 423g/mi \[4\]. Traveled distance is simplified as linear distance.

### Technical development:

The basis of the HubCab tool is a data set of over 170 million taxi trips of all 13,500 Medallion taxis in New York City in 2011. The data set contains GPS coordinates of all pickup and drop off points and corresponding times.

Cartographic data of street shapes were obtained from OpenStreetMap. The streets were cut into over 200,000 street segments of 40m length each with a Python script and the help of the shapely Python library, and imported into a MongoDB. Pickup and drop off points were matched to the closest street segments. Street types unlikely to contain taxi drop offs or pickups, such as footpaths, trunks, service roads, etc. were not used in the matching process. Line widths of yellow and blue street segments on low zoom levels were styled on a logarithmic scale. The pickup and drop off points, represented as dots on the high zoom levels, were generated via an Arcpy script, being placed randomly within a box around a given street segment with the box width again following a logarithmic scale. GPX files of the dots were styled using Maperitive, then merged and amended for different zoom levels. The dots and street line files were layered together with MapBox, which is the platform that streams all the map content.

The data back end of HubCab runs on a MongoDB, containing all street segments and their coordinates, and all flows between each pair of street segments. The number of all possible street segment pairs is over 40 billion (200,000 times 200,000) per map. Radius selection is dynamic, using MongoDB's $near function to obtain flows from all segments within the radius of the pickup marker to all segments within the radius of the drop off marker. With nine maps (one for the yearly data, eight for 3-hour time segments on all Fridays/Saturdays) and three selectable radii, there is a total of over one trillion flow combinations that can be explored with HubCab. Communication between MongoDB and the front end is realized via PHP scripts and Javascript+JSONP.

### Author(s):

Ross Tredinnick and Carrie Roy

### Abstract:

There is value in being able to distill correspondence, publications, literary works, speeches, notes and other groupings of texts down to their key concepts or vocabulary. There are also many ways to assess the important therms or ideas in a text. Evaluating word frequency is one method that has gained popularity through information graphics such as word clouds or weighted wordlists. However, such representations tend to focus on a single text or a singular grouping of texts. The research objective behind the development of WordCAKE (Collated Aggregate of Key Elements) focused on examining how frequently occurring words change over sequential texts (across time, chapters, versions, or any sequential ordering). Additional features were also developed that could augment our understanding of word trends by visually representing multiple texts along with their individual and overall high frequency words, specific word counts, and contextual information.

WordCAKE is a freely available plugin for SketchUp and can be described as a layered representation of high frequency words in multiple texts where each layer or disc represents one text. Key or central words in one text are positioned in the center of a disc. Color highlights words with high overall frequency in the corpus of texts. Any word can be easily located through the alphabetical arrangements of words clockwise, around the disc. Users can also select sections of a WordCAKE to export data to CSV files for further analysis.

### Quotes from Reviewers:

"This would prove extremely useful to literary critics, historians, sociologists, philosophers, cultural theorists---anyone who primarily uses texts to gain insight into the worldview of those who lived before us. One potential drawback is the limited size of the dataset, but this will become less of a factor as more and more texts become digitized."

"Nice way to visualize numerous texts concurrently."

ScripThreads
============

![](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/8/4/000190/resources/images/figure02.jpg)

  

### Website(s):

[http://victorianeyes.com/Predicting\_Dickens](http://victorianeyes.com/Predicting_Dickens)

### Author(s):

Kevin Ponto, Eric Hoyt and Carrie Roy

### Abstract:

The ScripThreads software prototype is a cross-platform tool for the analysis and visualization of screenplays. The tool aims to help researchers “see” stories through multiple visualizations of narrative structure and character in/activity over time––not real time, but the amount of time/text required to convey a given narrative. The tool is written in C++ and utilizes the QT toolkit for its graphical user interface, making it easily ported to multiple systems. ScripThreads takes in text and HTML file screenplays as an input, parses these files and generates data for visualization and analysis. Currently, the tool can detect character instances and scene shifts in screenplay format. It automatically ranks characters by occurrence, assigning a colored “character thread” to each character, and visually renders co-occurrence of characters in a scene. The tool creates a character “presence graph,” an “absence graph,” a unique “narrative structure” visualization (through the use of a force-directed algorithm), a character “color weave” visualization, and an “increasing graph” highlighting the simple presence or absence of a character in a given scene. Time is represented vertically in the first four, and corresponds with a scrollable window containing the entire screenplay on the left. Each scene shift is alternatively colored gray or white. In the force-directed visualization, a character can be selected and physically centered, revealing his or her role in the overall narrative structure of the story. Customizable character lists, “break string” terms, character detection, coloring, and name display are also included. The tool generates images of the different visualizations for aggregate analysis and produces a CSV on character statistics as well as a CSV on scene statistics to enable further statistical analysis. Additional applications include literary comparisons and animal behavior data (with some manual alterations to file format).

WitchHunter and TrollFinder
===========================

[![](images/submissions/11/WitchHunter_TrollFinder.jpg)](http://etkspace.scandinavian.ucla.edu/maps/witchhunter.html)

  

### Website(s):

[http://etkspace.scandinavian.ucla.edu/maps/witchhunter.html](http://etkspace.scandinavian.ucla.edu/maps/witchhunter.html)

### Author(s):

Timothy Tangherlini and Peter Broadwell

### Abstract:

These tools focus on the relationship of stories to the geographic environment.

WitchHunter asks, “where are story topics concentrated geographically?” Historical maps are used as a base layer, and results from the queries are projected onto the map. Multiple layers can be chosen to see a visual representation of the concentration of story topics in relation to one another. A checkbox allows the user to overlay contemporary map layers so that changes in land use during the past century can also be explored in the context of these stories. Currently, the stories are classified based on an existing index, although other classifiers can be substituted. The geographic representations are of two types and, users can select one or both: heat maps and geo-located histograms. Heat maps assume that stories “decay” in the surrounding area based on a heat-kernel distribution, while histograms assume that stories concentrate at specific points. Together, the two visualizations provide helpful information on the relative geographic distributions of story topics. Clicking on a histogram provides a “drill-down” to the underlying story and attendant metadata.

TrollFinder inverts the question and asks, “for any arbitrarily chosen area, what are the topics that appear in this area?” The tool makes use of the same map interface as WitchHunter. The user draws a bounding box on the map, and the tool returns three lists of story keywords ranked according to several different methods. The first list is a simple ranking of raw counts, the second is based on a new algorithm, RF-IPF, described in Broadwell and Tangherlini (2015), and the third provides a frequency-normalized ranking. Clicking on any of the points on the map displayed by the tool provides a list of the coordinates, places, and texts generating the point.

GhostScope and TreasureX
========================

[![](images/submissions/11/GhostScope_TreasureX.jpg)](http://etkspace.scandinavian.ucla.edu/maps/ghostscope.html)

  

### Website(s):

[http://etkspace.scandinavian.ucla.edu/maps/ghostscope.html](http://etkspace.scandinavian.ucla.edu/maps/ghostscope.html)

### Author(s):

Timothy Tangherlini and Peter Broadwell

### Abstract:

GhostScope and TreasureX emphasize the role of individual storytellers in tradition, and consider the story geography from their perspective, relating the places they mention in their stories to the places where they were when they told their stories. Taken together, these tools help present the “conceptual” map storytellers have of their surroundings.

GhostScope asks the question, “where and how far away are the ghosts (and other topics)?” We represent this by placing all of the narrators at an imagined “zero” point, and then calculate relative distance and direction from the places of collection (where the narrators were when they told their stories) to the places mentioned in their stories. The stories are classified according to the same classification schemata used for our other macroscope tools. The relative distances and directions are represented through a series of visualizations. Two graphs—one a line graph, the other a histogram chart—show the distance from zero with numbers of places mentioned along the y-axis and distances along the x-axis. A series of binned compass-rose histograms reveal the frequency of cardinal directions, while a heat map and a point distribution map show the direction and distance from center.

TreasureX uses real-world geography, and relates the places of collection to the stories told. Based on the same classifications used for the other tools, the TreasureX visualization builds on WitchHunter, using directional arrows to represent a geographic bigraph of directionality and distance, where storyteller nodes are anchored at the geo-coordinates of the place where the story was told, and story nodes are anchored at the geo-coordinates of the places mentioned in the story.

Working with both tools, a researcher can switch back and forth between the conceptual landscape and the geographical landscape, deriving a better understanding of the spatial relationships between environment and stories.

### Author(s):

Timothy Tangherlini and Peter Broadwell

### Abstract:

The Danish Folklore Nexus is designed to provide access to a complex, curated subcorpus of the Danish folk stories that Evald Tang Kristensen collected during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It was developed as a corrective to the topic-driven manner in which most folklore collections are presented. Focusing on the approximately 450 stories told by five main storytellers, and augmented by an additional 500 stories, the Nexus provides access to the largest collection of English language translations of Nordic folklore ever assembled. These stories are supplemented by comprehensive chapters on the history of folklore collecting in Scandinavia, and by detailed biographies of the main storytellers.

Rather than organizing stories according to topics, the Nexus allows users to explore the complex collection from a variety of perspectives: people, places, field collection trips, story topics, and keywords are just several of the main navigation modes. Navigation is effected through a combination of maps, indices, and timelines, while searching is always possible on themes, keywords, or through a recommendation system driven by machine-learning algorithms. Rich story annotations, access to Danish and English language versions of each story, as well as access to the underlying field diaries the folklorist used during collection allow for continuing layers of engagement with the materials. Through interaction with the Nexus, users can ask—and answer—increasingly complex questions about this material. Geography is ever-present in the Nexus and the clear relationship between storytelling and the local environment is presented through a straightforward mapping interface that includes historically accurate maps.

The Nexus is intended to function as a “standalone” application that can be used with or without an Internet connection. In the presence of a connection, richer maps and other updated information become available, while the absence of such a connection does not significantly interfere with the user’s experience of the Nexus.

Events, Places, and Dynamics of Research Networks: Mapping Genetics Research with an Interactive Timeline
=========================================================================================================

### Abstract:

Genbank Timeline is showcase of the events, places, and dynamics of research networks derived from the metadata describing DNA/RNA sequences that are submitted to NCBI’s international data repository “Genbank.” The metadata contain information on coauthorship, taxonomic lineages, publications associated with the datasets, geographic locations of authors, and other information. In the time period (1983-2013) covered by this dataset, there were 175,889,683 DNA data annotations, covering 814,196 organisms, deposited in GenBank. The submissions included 688,737 direct submissions of data and 330,348 unique references to journal articles. After author named entity resolution, 545,345 unique authors were identified as having contributed to the community. The GenBank Timeline is an attempt to tie evolving collaboration networks of the international research community with external epidemiological and policy events as well as technical advances in genomics research.

The format of a timeline offers a different way to look at the Big (Meta)Data from data repositories such as GenBank. The events and places that are coupled with visualizations of the research networks enable exploratory analysis of such data in the context of public health, policy, and technology influencers, thus providing some context to the results obtained through complex network analytic (CNA) approaches to the studies of scientific communities.

The metadata from GenBank were processed and stored in a database for manipulation and analysis, and the statistical analysis software R was used. Macroscopic and statistical analysis revealed the “small world” reality of genetics research, with a highly connected giant component, some solo-publishing scientists, and evidence of the cyclic patterns of collaboration, as well as scientists’ structural roles in the collaboration network.

The featured data in the current version of GenBank Timeline tool focus on scientific collaboration networks and provide opportunities for inspecting, manipulating, and exploring the research networks associated with outbreaks such as West Nile Virus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) as well as technological advances (e.g. PCR sequencing technologies) and policy changes. Subsets of data were extracted, analyzed, and visualized using R, which were then processed and showcased using Timeline JS software. The results were categorized into disease outbreaks, important developments in Genetics R&D, technological developments and policy decisions. This timeline is an ongoing work and future data analyses will be added when they are available.

nodegoat
========

  

### Website(s):

[http://nodegoat.net](http://nodegoat.net)

### Author(s):

Pim van Bree and Geert Kessels

### Abstract:

nodegoat is a generic research environment. This makes nodegoat a tool in the most fundamental meaning of the word. As it was not built to answer a single research question or make sense out of a delimited dataset, it is open for any user (scientist or not) to create, analyse, and visualise datasets, and to answer complex research questions. Like the archetypical microscope, nodegoat is a macroscope that aims to offer new perspectives on data, whatever this may be. nodegoat allows users to enrich data with relational, geographical and temporal attributes. This makes the modes of analysis inherently diachronic and ready-to-use for interactive maps and extensive trailblazing.

A researcher is able to publish their data by opening up their whole dataset or present their observations and outcomes by preparing ‘scenarios’. A scenario is a combination of

*   filtering, what data selection do I want to show?
*   scope, what context do I want to add?
*   conditions, how do I want to show certain aspects of the data?
*   frame, what is the starting point in time and space to explore the data?

  

This automatically means that every step and choice made from the initial data source to the aggregated presentation is made explicit, an integral part of the research process. This is especially a valuable opportunity for sciences that traditionally do not integrate technology or only focus on the output of the research process (i.e. books, articles). Whereas the creation of scenarios is technical and advanced, the presentation and usage is aimed to support generally accessible complexity.

Anyone is able to interact with scenarios through public user interfaces and ‘herder’. Herder is the communication class between nodegoat and a user. Herder commands nodegoat both by soft (e.g. tablet) and hardware buttons (e.g. sliders). By combining curation (scenarios, prepared by a researcher) and the interaction (user), anyone is able to meaningfully explore highly complex and contextualised data. The first instance of herder will be implemented on correspondence analysis of the brothers Grimm at the Grimmwelt museum in Kassel this year [http://www.stadt-kassel.de/projekte/grimm-welt/](http://www.stadt-kassel.de/projekte/grimm-welt/).

The nodegoat video tutorials provide a quick intro on how nodegoat can be used by any scholar to set up a custom data structure, manage data, analyse data and produce meaningful data visualisations: [http://nodegoat.net/blog.s/7/nodegoat-video-tutorials](http://nodegoat.net/blog.s/7/nodegoat-video-tutorials)

nodegoat does not feature a single dataset and visualisation, but facilitates the creation, configuration, and visualisation of various use cases. Therefore, we want to highlight the explorative nature of nodegoat and its presentational value by means of nodegoat-’scenarios’:

See this video to see an example of an scenario inside the working environment: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G\_19shcV2vM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_19shcV2vM). The data in this video comes from a project of the University of Luxembourg that maps migrational patterns of mineworkers.

The nodegoat viewer offers access to a scenario in a public user interface: [http://mnn.nodegoat.net/viewer](http://mnn.nodegoat.net/viewer). Click the red tiles to open an scenario, noteworthy is the scenario ‘Conelis Meijer’. The data in this user interfaces comes from a collaborative project of various Dutch research institutes and universities on seventeenth century artists as they moved throughout the world. To explore this data (and all scenarios) within the working environment, go to http://nodegoat.net/ and login with the username ‘demo\_mnn’ and password ‘demo’. By switching between the public user interface and the working environment, you will get an understanding of the dynamics between the creation mode and the presentation mode in nodegoat.

The displayed network shows entities – topical terms, authors, journals, and Dewey decimal classes – which are most related lexically to the terms of the query. The interactive network visualization is built in a two-step process. Off-line, for each entity a vector is defined, which components are built from one category of the entities, the topical terms. The values of an entity vector represent the frequency with which this entity co-occurs with the topical terms in the 65 million article records of ArticleFirst, an article database of OCLC. This vector defines the lexical context of an entity and together they form a large matrix presenting the whole problem space. Random projection reduces this problem space to a reasonable size where it is possible to compute, in real-time, the lexical relatedness between roughly 1M topical terms, 2.6M authors, 738 Dewey decimal codes and 35K journals of the ArticleFirst dataset. The final 2D rendering of the network takes into account their relatedness to the query and to each other. (for more details see Koopman et al, 2015, CHI)

In the interactive network visualization different types of entities are color coded. For instance, journals are green, texts blue, and authors yellow. For the Dewey classification numbers each class is also color coded. The latter gives a very high level immediate impression of the disciplines the query resonates most with (see the dewey view of the Machine Learning journal). Colors are explain in a legend. A simple menu on top of the page allows to select specific entities, and also to determine the number of entities to be shown (show slider). Readability of labels can be adjusted with the font-slider, but for the rest the visualization is purposefully designed as simple as possible.

Each of the nodes is clickable on, and clicking on it the user traverses through contexts of entities. At any step, one can choose to have a specific view, e.g. authors or subjects only. To our knowledge, this is the first tool to allow seamlessly to explore, in real-time, different types of entities and their relationship to a search string.

Originally designed for the specific problem of author disambiguation, Ariadne has evolved into a tool to simultaneously browse through different entities: authors, subjects, journals, etc. The interface allows exploring the lexical, social and source context of a query in the world of published literature. Embedded are look-up functions for the query string in other global Internet sources, such as Wikipedia, Google Scholar and the world’s largest library catalogue – WorldCat. Ariadne provides a red thread to follow and evaluate the context of a search query.

### Related Projects/Works

Currently, bibliographic databases are dominated by a single search term window and ranked lists of results. Maps are only occasionally implemented. Examples are the AuthorMapper for SpringerLink, the co-author graph for Microsoft Academic Search, or HistCite for Web of Science. On the other side, there is a need to create Macroscopes or overview about large bodies of information, and the success of enterprises as Places&Spaces has proven the need for knowledge maps. Still, interactive visual exploration is mostly possible in stand-alone tools such as the Sci2 tool or CitNetExplorer, for specifically extracted datasets from large bibliographic databases, as the Web of science or Scopus. We don’t know of any living interface into such large bibliographic databases. What we find are interactive visual navigation to be created in specific projects such as the MESUR project for clickstream data or the Gender Browser which operates on a dump of JSTOR. At the same time, information and computer scientists (HCI, InfVis, Visual Analytics) call for further experiments to navigate visually and interactively through large information spaces \[1, 2, 3\].

A Cultural History Macroscope
=============================

### Website(s):

[http://www.cultsci.net](http://www.cultsci.net)

### Authors(s):

Maximilian Schich and Mauro Martino

### Abstract:

On August 1st 2014, a "A Network Framework for Cultural History" was published in Science magazine \[1\], along with a 5-minute animation "Charting Culture" on the Nature video channel \[2\]. So far, the video has accumulated 1 million views on youtube. "The animation distills hundreds of years of culture into just five minutes, mapping cultural mobility by tracking more than 120,000 births and deaths of notable individuals. \[...\] Using them as a proxy for skills and ideas, the map reveals intellectual hotspots and tracks how empires rise and crumble. The information comes from Freebase, a Google-owned database of well-known people and places, and other catalogues of notable individuals."

The original purpose of the "Charting Culture" video was to summarize and promote results of an article published concurrently with the Nature video in Science Magazine. A poetic translation of two supplementary movies included in "A Network Framework of Cultural History", it helped to make the paper a top Science download of the month, while itself became one of the most viewed Nature videos in channel history.

Currently, we are in the process to add interactive experience to the cultsci.net website, which now contains a open-access-link to the Science paper and Nature video. The resulting macroscope website will go beyond the original video by breaking down individuals by genre and by zooming into selected regions and cultural centers. The final version of the enhanced macroscope website, will include further collaborators to be specifed and is scheduled to be premiered on September 18, 2015, with a major partner organization. It would be ready to exhibit on October 20 for the Scimap iteration 11.

### Quotes from Reviewers:

"A well-executed network visualization applied to an uncommon topic."

"A Cultural History Macroscope NATURE Arc graphs pride one of the most elegant ways to map multivariate data to get to a larger view of contextual information that can inspire deep discovery. This eloquent Macroscope applies both network and complexity theory as well as using the leading semantic web databanks to create such a visualization, integrating both arc diagrams and a simple geographic map in a provocative tool for scenario-building in time and space. In the Nature video, a narrative takes us through the dynamic mobility of intellectual collaboration and migration, historical trends and the impact of innovations through time and space. However, the same understanding could be provided by personal interactive access to this tool. By speeding up time, these macro-patterns of our global history can help the user predict possible future trends and potential innovations. Beautiful!"

"I really like the scope of this project as well as the created visualizations based on the analysis."

Learn Discovery – Mindmap of Wikipedia
======================================

### Authors(s):

Maximilian Schich and Mauro Martino

### Abstract:

"Learn Discovery" is a mobile app to visually make sense of every topic in encyclopedic public knowledge.

Patent application US 14/109235 describes a novel method to organize knowledge correlations into a multi-partite weighted graph; the mobile client interactively accesses the graph computed from the English Wikipedia.

Quality is benchmarked against Google Knowledge Graph: rather than suggestions for most popular topics, correlations are ordered by semantic proximity and found for all topics.

A dual-interface displays mind-maps as connected-graphs or textual-matrixes, to overview and summarize how correlations shape a subject. The app allows to visualize the context of any topic (correlations to its first neighbors) and from it navigate across diverse subjects; the proximity of correlations guides the knowledge discovery.

Tap on any topic to retrieve more neighbors; double tap to display web-pages about it (articles and video). Bookmark a map and recall its subject with the "Atlas" icon.

The work aims to engage general audiences in learning, communicating and reaching new knowledge (primarily science and facts), as opposed to usability of interfaces burdened with the limit of educational or technical expertise (info-graphics, browsing, filtered and faceted-navigation).

"Discovery" of correlations between topics is proposed as a complementary experience to "Search" for web-pages about a topic.

### Website(s):

[ibm.com/ibm/think/thinkexhibit.html](http://www.ibm.com/ibm/think/thinkexhibit.html)

### Authors(s):

IBM

### Abstract:

The exhibit combines three unique experiences to engage visitors in a conversation about how we can improve the way we live and work.

**Gesture wall**  
Visitors approaching the exhibit are drawn in by striking patterns displayed on a 40-foot gesture wall. The wall tells the stories of systems around us, transforming into an interactive space where visitor movement creates unique visualizations in dynamic shapes and color. To illustrate complex systems that are a part of daily life the wall also visualizes data from traffic, solar energy, and air quality.

**Immersive film**  
Further inside the exhibit space, visitors discover a theater space featuring a 12-minute immersive film. A kaleidoscope of images and sound fill the large screen. They are enveloped in a rich narrative about the pattern of progress, told through awe-inspiring stories of the past and present. The film reveals how progress was made possible by a combination of people and technology, and by taking a distinct approach to making the world work better -- seeing, mapping, understanding, believing and acting. Guests are inspired to think about humankind's quest for progress, and about making our world work better, today.

**Interactive experience**  
Visitors explore a media field composed of 20 seven-foot interactive touchscreens, transforming the space into a forest of discovery. Visitors can explore our quest to see more-from clocks and scales to microscopes and telescopes, RFID chips and biomedical sensors. They learn how maps have been used to track data, from early geographical maps to the most recent databases and data visualization platforms. They interact with the models used to understand the complex behaviors of our world-from weather prediction algorithms to virus spread simulations. They hear from leaders of world-changing initiatives about how they built belief. And they read about some of the most inspiring examples of systemic progress around the world.

**Icons matching game**  
Visitors engage with a selection of the Icons of Progress, seen throughout the exhibit space, in a dynamic matching game. To celebrate a successful match, guests are able to take a photo of themselves, compose an answer to the question: 'How would you make the world work better?' and email this with the game score as a virtual postcard to remember and share exhibit experience.

**Data center**  
Visitors are given a glimpse into the inner workings of an onsite data center through a viewing window with prompts for understanding how computing power can be utilized to make the world work better. The data center at the exhibit contributes to the World Community Grid project, harnessing computer power around the world to tackle some of today's most challenging problems.

### Quotes from Reviewers:

"IBM Think! combines a variety of rich user experiences, including data visualization in the Gesture Wall. Also, there's a strong interaction component in the third user experience, which fits well with the "interaction" part of the exhibit theme. The worldwide computer network project fits well with the _Places & Spaces_ aspect on a major level, as does the Gesture Wall on a micro level. Mostly, the goal is lofty; the macroscope set aims "to engage visitors in a conversation about how we can improve the way we live and work."

"An exhibit that contributed greatly for the awareness of data visualization and pushed its limits with a set of large, highly engaging and immersive experiences."

"The major innovation of this multi-tool, multimedia installation is the use of a 40 ft long gesture wall as a collaborative navigation interface to provide access to the power of a Global Community Grid of scientists and planetary citizens. This is quite an exciting endeavor! The experiential 'IBM Think' appeals to all ages and provides both high impact data visualization a with more intimate stories and humanitarian causes. I like how this Macroscope encourages global activism by empowering users with direct access to both stories and science of human and earth systems. The 10-year old World Community Grid provides a solid source of research data, effective problem-solving tools and collaborations between scientists and citizens. It will be exciting to see how it evolves in the next ten years."

### Abstract:

This proposed exhibit features a set of 6 online visualizations that explore global human society through the lens of georeferenced narratives live-translated from local news media throughout the world in 65 languages. All six visualizations are based on the GDELT Project ([gdeltproject.org](http://gdeltproject.org/)), an open data realtime index over global media, monitoring one of the highest-resolution catalogs of local news media worldwide, machine translating that material in realtime from 65 languages, and identifying the people, locations, organizations, themes, sources, emotions, counts, quotes, and events driving global society ([blog.gdeltproject.org/gdelt-2-0-our-global-world-in-realtime](http://blog.gdeltproject.org/gdelt-2-0-our-global-world-in-realtime/)). The first visualization explores the natural “geographic communities” encoded in how the world’s news media groups countries together, using the Google Arms Globe engine by permission for its visual. The second offers a realtime topical and entity search of worldwide news, placing the results spatially according to the locations mentioned in context with the topic within the articles – instead of placing coverage by byline, it places it according to the contextual geographic narrative. Visualizations 3 and 4 explore the world according to the primary language and average emotion of coverage about each location on earth, respectively. Visualization 5 is a longitudinal view of three months of global coverage of wildlife crime and the locations affected, while 6 inverts the notion of news browsing, offering a clickable map of all monitored coverage relating to every location on earth. Visualizations 2-6 use the CartoDB.com mapping platform to create interactive mobile-optimized experiences and update hourly except for 5. Each explores the use of space as a fundamentally new lens through which to understand global society. A new partnership with CartoDB, announced June 4th, extends these visualizations by making a set of tools available for ordinary citizens to instantly create their own maps of global society through the news.

### Quotes from Reviewers:

"Local News: The sheer size of the data set and the difficulty of bringing linguistic order to global data is particularly impressive. This macroscope manages also to be extremely informative, visually arresting, and highly addictive."

"An intriguing way to interpret local news as data. It illustrates such a variety of approaches to making sense of the same data, and does so with a global scope."

"Acquire a more holistic understanding of what humans do and how they feel around the world by exploring major news data feeds in 65 languages together with associated pictures, videos, and emotions."

### Authors(s):

Juhan Sonin, Eric Benoit, and Jon Follett

### Abstract:

hGraph (Health Graph) is a standardized visual representation of a patient's health status, designed to increase awareness of the individual's factors that can affect one's overall health. hGraph displays a complete overview of an individual's health. This single picture method provides a person with a significant understanding of his or her total well being because it compiles multiple metrics into a unified graph that can be viewed at a glance.

hGraph users can easily identify which metrics exist in a normal range versus those that may be too high or low. It effectively conveys important data at sizes both large and small, and enables users to recognize condition patterns. With hGraph, patients can track their own health and healthcare providers can learn to recognize representative visualizations for common diseases.

### Authors(s):

Jack Dangermond and Angela Lee

### Abstract:

The Urban Observatory enables comparisons among cities through maps on topics ranging from transit access and health resources to noise pollution and water quality. The app presents data for dozens of cities in a common framework that allows direct comparison. In addition, the maps are linked so that as the viewer zooms in on one city, the other maps zoom in parallel.

Data from a variety of authoritative sources are standardized, and cities around the globe are invited to participate in the project. As the proportion of population that lives in cities increases, from 50% in 2015 to a projected 70% by 2050, the importance of understanding how cities work and how to keep them working increases as well.

### Quotes from Reviewers:

"Urban observatory has a very well designed HCI and ability to compare is very useful. Color index is a little unclear, and sometimes the descriptions are hard to correlate to the actual map."

"I think ESRI's 3 year old web-based Urban Observatory is an incredibly effective Macroscope for large-scale comparisons of urban systems throughout the globe. Its big datasets of both long-term and current data are analyzed and visualized within the context of geographic information systems (GIS), a world standard. Users can access this intuitive, vibrant comparative experience through the Urban Observatory App and inside the upcoming spatial media installation at the Smithsonian Institution. This Macroscope encourages civic clarity and responsibility through understanding how the most successful urban environments are designed and how each user's own city can be improved."

"This macroscope shines in terms of its ease of use. Multiple kinds of data and a voluminous list of cities allow the user to ask questions and compare cities that hold particular meaning to them."

"Maps that change your mind and help design smart cities."

"Great tool that summarizes massive amounts of geographic data for comparison!"

### Authors(s):

Morton Heilig

### Abstract:

In 1961, American cinematographer and inventor Morton L. Heilig filed a patent for the Sensorama. The Sensorama 3D movies featured stereo images, wide vision, motion, color, stereo sound, aromas, wind, and vibrations to provide full sensual vividness and dynamic vitality. The default experience shipped with the Sensorama was a series of journeys, including a motorcycle ride through Brooklyn (complete with seat vibrations mimicking the motor of the bike, the smell of baking pizza, wind from strategically placed fans, voices of people walking down sidewalks) and a view of a belly-dancer (with cheap perfume).
