Carrie Longley on communicating science through sculpture
---------------------------------------------------------

Sculptor Carrie Longleyâ€™s contribution to _Places & Spaces_ is a work of touchable data that brings together the realms of scientific research and artistic expression. In this interview, she reveals why this project challenged her artistic process and explains how the tactile, three-dimensional quality of clay sculpture can convey facets of data that image and text cannot.
