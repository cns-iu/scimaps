Places & Spaces at Duke University
==================================

January 12 - April 10, 2015
---------------------------

Are you interested in seeing science from above? Curious to see what impact one single person or invention can have? Keen to find pockets of innovation? Desperate for better tools to manage the information flood? Or are you simply fascinated by maps? Then plan to visit the _Places & Spaces: Mapping Science_ exhibit, which will be on display at Duke University from January 12 to April 10, 2015.  
  
The exhibit aims to demonstrate the power of maps to navigate and make sense of physical places and abstract topic spaces. Scientists will be stimulated, students and teachers encouraged, and the general public fascinated by this multi-layered, accessible approach to the worlds of modern scientific thought.  
  
This is only the second time the [10th iteration](/iteration/10/ "10th iteration"), which debuted in September 2014, is being displayed publicly. These fascinating new maps explore the future of science mapping and continue the exhibit’s commitment to bringing audiences the most stunning and groundbreaking examples of data visualization from the most brilliant mapmakers of our time.  
  
The maps and bonus materials will be on display in three separate venues: [The Edge: The Ruppert Commons for Research, Technology, and Collaboration](http://library.duke.edu/edge), hosted by Data and Visualization Services; the 3rd floor of [Gross Hall](http://sites.duke.edu/grosshall/), hosted by the [Information Initiative at Duke (iiD)](http://bigdata.duke.edu/); and the 2nd floor of Bay 11 of [Smith Warehouse](http://myatlascms.com/map/?id=21&mrkIid=2871), hosted by the [Information Science + Information Studies](http://isis.duke.edu/) program. Katy Börner will formally present the exhibit to visitors on January 21 at 4pm in the Jones Open Lab, located in the Edge.
