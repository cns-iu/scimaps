About the _Places & Spaces_ exhibition
======================================

Drawing from across cultures and across scholarly disciplines, _Places & Spaces: Mapping Science_ demonstrates the power of maps to address vital questions about the contours and content of human knowledge. An interdisciplinary and international advisory board chose each one of the works in the _Places & Spaces: Mapping Science_ exhibit as an outstanding example of how visualization can bring patterns in scientific data into focus. The exhibit is curated by the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center at Indiana University. The exhibit has been on display at over 382 venues in 28 countries on 6 continents. It showcases the work of 248 mapmakers that hail from 17 different countries.
