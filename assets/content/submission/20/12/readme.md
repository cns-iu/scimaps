    Around the globe, many people are facing significant water security threats in a variety of ways. Primarily these are related to water pollution, wastewater removal, sanitation, water supply and both the associated socio-economic and health impacts resultant from droughts and floods. People living in quickly expanding urban areas and developing countries are often affected by water security threats the most.


    Responsible and effective water management represents one of humanityâ€™s most complex challenge - droughts and floods, pollution and water conflicts in combination with rapid urbanisation, an ever-growing demand for energy and food, migration pressures and climate change. In the face of such challenges, water retains the ability to connect people and provide them with many opportunities. Adaptive and specific solutions and methodologies on how to tackle water-related issues have been developed globally and encompass a diverse collection of solutions and management techniques.
