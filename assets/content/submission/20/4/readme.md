    The Russia-Ukraine conflict has highlighted the intricate nature of global supply chains, a complex network connecting nations and propagating disruptions to distant regions. Previous studies often concentrate on direct dependencies, neglecting indirect dependencies caused by the lack of essential inputs, making a comprehensive assessment of the global supply system challenging. In response to these complexities, we have developed a visualization based on research at CSH that allows to explore different scenarios and provides a holistic view of both indirect and direct global effects of supply disruptions. The tool delves into two critical aspects: food availability and trade sanctions. It demonstrates how localized production disruptions can have far-reaching implications, impacting trade relationships and the entire production chain. For instance, a shock to Ukrainian maize production not only affects maize availability but also leads to losses in pig or poultry meat due to a shortage of animal feed. This aspect of the visualization helps us fully appreciate the extent of potential losses when a specific product ceases production in a country. Additionally, the project explores the cascading effects of import scarcity caused by trade sanctions. As primary and intermediary imports decline, domestic production is disrupted, and demand for goods in the affected country decreases. This creates a ripple effect, influencing global trade dynamics. Our visualization tool is based on robust research models, and it is not only informative but also interactive, allowing users to explore the consequences of different scenarios involving global supply disruptions in a dynamic and engaging manner. By going beyond traditional representations, it engages viewers and connects them to the underlying data. Through this project, we hope to foster a deeper understanding of the intricacies of supply chains and their vulnerabilities. As the world continues to face unpredictable challenges, this visualization stands as a powerful resource for gaining insights into the dynamics of the global economy and potential vulnerabilities of supply networks for policymakers and businesses alike.
