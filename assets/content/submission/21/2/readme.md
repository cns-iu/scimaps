    “Time Rewind” by performance and multimedia artist Maria Magdalena is a multi-layered video artwork that invites viewers into a space where history, technology, and human expression converge. Conveying a visionary interplay between different means of expression and intelligences, the work connects profoundly transformational eras—such as the Renaissance and the current digital age—to visualize transcendent scientific breakthroughs through performance and multimedia art.


    At the heart of “Time Rewind” lies a poetic and intellectual reanimation of Leonardo da Vinci’s perspective study. Through a seamless blend of live performance, an iconic hand-drawn Renaissance study, and contemporary digital projection, the artwork brings historical insight into dialogue with modern means of expression. Maria Magdalena’s performance acts as a bridge between worlds, turning theoretical complexity into sensory experience. By embodying a corporeal response to concepts like time, proportion, and innovation, she gives form to otherwise elusive ideas, offering a deeply reflective meditation on the interconnectedness of art and science.  


    The work introduces a layered re-reading of the Renaissance ideal: Maria Magdalena’s figure brings forth a fluid, feminine perspective, that complements da Vinci's Golden Section once defining a rigid, masculine worldview. Landmarks of technological progress, culturally associated with rational intelligence and the masculine world, are intersected by the emancipated figure of Mary Magdalene, vindicating the indispensable relevance of feminine intelligence to create a totality of collaborative harmony, dissolving linear paradigms and inviting a new visionary equilibrium. In this overlay, a novel space emerges—one where the traditional and the innovative, the masculine and the feminine intelligences not only coexist but thrive in collaboration.


    Through interdisciplinary practice, “Time Rewind” embodies a holistic intelligence, revealing the potential of creativity as both a scientific and human inquiry. By reinterpreting past knowledge through a contemporary lens, Maria Magdalena encourages us to reflect on how intelligence itself—embodied, historical, scientific, and creative—can help us create promising visions for the future.
