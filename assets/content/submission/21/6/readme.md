    This interactive visualization reveals how workforces and markets adaptively respond to the net-zero transition, demonstrating collaborative intelligence across human and systemic actors. By modeling occupational mobility as a dynamic network (539 occupations across 11 categories), it uncovers two layers of intelligent adaptation: at the individual level, workers navigate branching pathways between jobs based on skill compatibility, while at the systemic level, demand self-organizes into emergent 'scale-up' and 'scale-down' phases.
