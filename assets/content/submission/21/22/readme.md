    Abel & I (2024) is an interactive simulation that visualizes the ambiguous boundary between human and machine intelligence through an intimate, live exchange between a viewer and a synthetic avatar named Abel. The piece enables unscripted text-based conversation with an AI-driven male version of myself, situated within a physical installation. Abel responds using a custom large language model, real-time simulation in Unreal Engine, and a bespoke Python script that connects emotional nuance with machine logic.


    Synthesized from an archive of personal messages exchanged with former partners, Abel functions as the “perfectly distant boyfriend”: always present, always removed. He appears across multiple works I’ve created, including Gen/esis (2024) and Meta-Mahala (2023), anchoring a through-line in my exploration of computer-generated images, machine intelligence, and synthetic subjectivity. The visualization centers emotional, relational, and linguistic intelligences as they emerge through human–machine interaction. His face is created from a 3D scan of my own and reconfigured using CGI tools, embodying a hybrid image that interrogates authenticity, agency, and self-mediation.


    Designed for broad public engagement, the work resonates with audiences navigating contemporary forms of disembodied connection. It raises critical questions about agency, gendered dynamics, and the role of synthetic identities in shaping affective experience. While it may seem uncanny to text with an artificial partner, the work poses a deeper question: what is the difference, really, when we ourselves are mediated for others—curated, disembodied, and fragmented across platforms? If technology already embodies our loved ones as avatars, what does it matter if my boyfriend has no physical body?


    By visualizing and enacting a deeply human kind of intelligence through technological means, Abel & I reframes the emotional stakes of AI and invites reflection on how we co-evolve with our digital reflections.
