    Philosophers of science need to be familiar with the object of their study. Part of this familiarity can come from their own scientific training, interviews, and interactions with working scientists, or case studies of historical developments. However, the picture emerging from these localised methods is likely to be incomplete: Modern science is fast, vast, and difficult to grasp in its interdisciplinary entirety.


    Data-driven methods have emerged in philosophy of science as one way to address this problem. OpenAlex Mapper (https://tinyurl.com/OAmapper) is an interactive project designed to link philosophical investigations to large corpora of scientific material.


    OpenAlex Mapper allows users to project arbitrary search queries, which can be for search strings, but also persons, institutions, cited works, etc., to the OpenAlex database, which is the largest open database of scientific material available, onto an interactively explorable, machine-learning-generated base-map of the sciences. This enables philosophers to quickly check whether hypothesised patterns in the structure, development, and interrelation of scientific fields hold up at scale. As a serendipitous search tool, it also opens the door to exploration of unexpected details and connections.


    We originally built OpenAlex Mapper to study model transfer: the phenomenon whereby models, alongside their conceptualisations and associated computational methodologies, developed in one domain are transported into entirely different areas of inquiry. This process appears crucial to the collective creativity of science, rendering it a highly adaptive intelligent system.


    But while the tool was initially developed to probe philosophical puzzles around model-based unification of the sciences, its deeper purpose is to facilitate genuinely data-driven inquiry in philosophy of science. It not only provides answers particular research questions but also anchors philosophical intuitions in large-scale empirical patterns, revealing epistemic dynamics across disciplines that would remain invisible from ground level.
