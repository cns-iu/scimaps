    Cyberfungi is an interactive sound installation that visualuzes fungal communication through sound. The project is inspired by the research of Professor Adamatzky and his team at the University of the West of England, who study the electrical activity of fungi.

    The installation uses an array of photoresistors and ML to transform light into digital signals that resemble the electrical patterns observed in fungal experiments. These signals control generative sound models that is played in multichannel sound system. Visitors can influence the installation by altering the light levels near ceramic sculptures of fungi.

    At the core of the installation is a system for interpreting and transforming data in real time. Light levels detected by photoresistors are processed through ML and AI trained on a dataset provided by A. Adamatzky. These models simulate signal patterns similar to those observed in mycelial networks, generating soundscape. Rather than visualizing this data through graphs or diagrams, the project sonifies it — allowing audiences to perceive abstract biological signals as dynamic sound. Through this, the work translates complex scientific data into a sensory and affective experience.

    The sound resembles a kind of low, organic rumble — punctuated by static, interruptions, and shifting frequencies. It evokes the feeling of endlessly tuning a radio, trying to reach a signal that never quite comes through. This sonic metaphor reflects the conceptual core of the work: the communicative boundary we can never fully cross in our relationship with the  non-human other.

    Scientific studies of plant and fungal communication are rapidly evolving, yet remain difficult to grasp. Art, positioned at the threshold between image and data, offers a unique form of interpretation that makes invisible and slow electrical communication of fungi tangible. Fungal communication is difficult to represent through visual imagery or schematic diagrams. The line between visual speculation and scientific accuracy is extremely delicate. In Cyberfungi, the challenge of creating a comprehensible representation while remaining faithful to scientific insight is addressed through the metaphor of language. Humans tend to understand communication through semantic models — structured, symbolic, and linear. This project deliberately abandons such direct language. Instead, it embraces sound as a medium that resists fixed form: it is always in the process of tuning, yet never settles into a defined signal. This unresolved state becomes a metaphor for the limits of understanding and the asymmetry of communication with non-human life.
