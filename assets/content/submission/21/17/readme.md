    Yet We Laugh is a lecture performance in which a narrator tries to explain what laughter and humor could mean to human beings. Based on text and sound, the project is an hybrid 45 minutes piece that invites audiences to reflect on humor's complex embodied and cultural phenomena, as well as witness the learning process of a machine attempting to laugh. The research in which the performance is based concerns laughter's effect on psychology and how performed theory can comment on the entanglement between humans, sound, language, objects and technology.
