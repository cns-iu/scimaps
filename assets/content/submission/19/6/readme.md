    Abstract: 


    We propose a general toolbox for the Now.museum - a "digital space" dedicated to individual and collective memories of significant events in our societies - whose context is informed by the collection and conservation of artifacts publicly available on the web. 

    Clearly, Covid-19 and its global spreading belong to these significant events and could be documented by sharing digital collections across specific societal sectors, scientific domains, etc. However, a question is “how to capture its double spreading dimensionality spatially and in time”? Even if several retrospective initiatives exist, an integrative data curation approach and interface on information and testimonies is still missing. Moreover, relatively little attention was given to the ‘voices’ of the public, their testimonies, experiences, losses, and aspirations. 

    Following the Open Science principle for science democratization, our macroscope – with its timeline interface -  answers these concerns with open data which provides context to individual experiences. Its infrastructural backbone consists in an open source archival platform (Dataverse) nourished from the capture of public parts of newspaper and social media, published in all Europe and in all languages since December 2019, including the term “Covid” in their title. 

    The interface is designed as a searchable timeline, where captures are displayed as thumbnails, and sources as well as topics are color coded. The captures are indexed using AI techniques and links are provided to the original contents. The interactive interface is accompanied by a number of static overview maps, tracing bursts and changes in terminology, paying attention to geographic spread and multilinguality. 

    The general design of the Now.museum as a space of cultural heritage, is applicable for any memory-collecting and sharing activity among the wider public, hence individual contributions are expected. To this end, a workflow is designed and a first implementation of ‘citizen/crowd material’ is given.


    PS: Domain names Now.museum and Covid-19.museum are the ownership of Yves Rozenholc since the beginning of April 2020. Their denominations have been validated by the ICOM (International Council of Museums) which controls the extension museum.

      A github repository  https://github.com/C19M/Covid-19.Museum describes the
      case, and contains links to the software code used. The timeline in
      essence runs on a Dataverse instance.
