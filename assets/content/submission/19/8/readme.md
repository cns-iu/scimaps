    Abstract: Is Food Making You Sick? is exploring the relationship between diet and health in 184 countries through the analysis and visualization of extensive data on nutritional factors and diseases. The project aims to study and visualize these relationships by juxtaposing 47 nutrients and 84 health conditions, allowing users to explore and analyze almost four thousand unique relationships. By exploring the patterns between food consumption and health outcomes, users could better inform their dietary choices and be empowered by high quality, research data. Exposing the data visually could also spark discussion amongst researchers, setting the stage for testing hypotheses and performing additional studies, challenging the knowledge we currently have. 


    The tool utilizes over 6 GB of data from the Global Dietary Database and the Global Burden of Disease. The data were cleaned, synchronized, and meaningful relationships were selected to be displayed in the final work. Visualizing these correlations in a highly customizable, interactive scatterplot, empowers users to explore relationships, analyze, and interpret complex data in a single, multilayered visualization. The powerful filtering options allow users to increase or decrease the complexity by adding or removing layers of information, utilizing color-coding or sizing of the circles representing each country to convey their geographic location or display additional metrics, such as population, obesity or underweight rates. This empowers users to customize their experience to reflect their analytical needs. Analysis is further supported by the ability to plot a regression line, indicating the direction and strength of each relationship. 


    Visualizing close to 4,000 unique relationships, the tool allows users to explore and analyze large amounts of data in a highly analytical way - an important starting point in learning more about what are the ways in which the food we consume may influence our health. 


    This interactive article presents a so-called “explorable explainer” of the k-means clustering algorithm. It attempts to push the envelope of how visual explanations can be designed on an interactive computational medium such as the web.


    This article explains the algorithm using a “scrollytelling” piece. As the reader scrolls through the article, not only do the visuals animate and transition accordingly with the text, the reader is also prompted to interact with these geometric visualizations of the algorithm, supplementing their intuition through hands-on experimentation with its inner workings.


    As the article progresses and introduces more concepts, it also slowly introduces corresponding knobs and dials that the reader can play around with. The article finally concludes with a dashboard or sandbox that comprises all the interactive controls that came before, giving the reader free rein to probe around and dissect the algorithm to improve their own understanding of its details as they please.
