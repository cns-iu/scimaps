short_description: "Marc Smith: Taking snapshots of virtual communities"
long_description: Marc A. Smith on why the internet has been a gift to
  sociologists and how a sociological perspective is useful in visualizing the
  shape of online communities. He observes that most human beings are equipped
  to respond quickly and intelligently to visual information. And because
  information visualization is designed to transmit data insights to a human
  observer, it represents “one of the most humanist corners of the computer
  sciences.”
