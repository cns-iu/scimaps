short_description: Kalev Leetaru on how news stories create unlikely communities
long_description: GDELT Project founder Kalev Leetaru reflects on the power of
  macroscopes to pinpoint key connections that might otherwise be lost amidst a
  glut of information. His Mapping Global News (2015) uses news stories from
  around the world to demonstrate how shared problems, mutual interests, and
  common goals can be as important as geographical proximity in the creation of
  global communities.
