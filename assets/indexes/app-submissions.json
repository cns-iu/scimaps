[{"title":"XXI. 21st Iteration Submissions","body":"<!--StartFragment-->\n\nThe *Places & Spaces: Envisioning Intelligences* exhibit aims to inspire discussion about intelligences by biological and technological life forms. It welcomes visualizations of linguistic, kinesthetic, communication, musical, emotional, and other intelligences with a focus on collaboration and coordination across life forms and intelligence types. The visualizations aim to surface strengths and weaknesses of existing and future sensors & actuators, memory & reasoning, exploration & communication, plus shared goals & desirable futures.\n\nEach year, submissions are reviewed by an international, interdisciplinary advisory board. Selected entries will be added to *Places & Spaces*, a traveling exhibit designed to open people’s minds and hearts to the value, complexity, and beauty of science and technology. The resulting collection will provide a glimpse into the future—a time when larger and more complex datasets are available, multi-factor analysis becomes commonplace, and human and machine intelligence merge in support of creative problem solving and positive societal impact.\n\n*Places & Spaces* currently features 100 maps from the 1st decade and 40 interactive macroscopes from the 2nd decade of the exhibit that cover data, code, and expertise from a wide range of disciplines. Since 2005, the exhibit has traveled to 30 countries and appeared in various formats at over 458 venues and events, including the Davos Economic Forum, National Academy of Sciences, and the New York Public Library. News coverage has appeared in *Nature*, *Science*, *USA Today*, and *Wired*.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->","thumbnails":[{"title":"The Opera of Dying Insects","image":"assets/content/submission/21/1/operasm.png","link":"submission/21/1"},{"title":"Time Rewind","image":"assets/content/submission/21/2/timerewindsm.png","link":"submission/21/2"},{"title":"Grand Tour","image":"assets/content/submission/21/3/grandtoursm.png","link":"submission/21/3"},{"title":"Shakespe(AI)re","image":"assets/content/submission/21/4/shakespe-ai-resm.png","link":"submission/21/4"},{"title":"The Knowledge Cosmos: A Playful, Immersive Platform for Interdisciplinary Research Discovery","image":"assets/content/submission/21/5/knowledgecosmossm.png","link":"submission/21/5"},{"title":"Labor Transitions in a Net-Zero Era","image":"assets/content/submission/21/6/labortranssm.png","link":"submission/21/6"},{"title":"Zoonotic Web","image":"assets/content/submission/21/7/zoonoticsm.png","link":"submission/21/7"},{"title":"Neural Connections","image":"assets/content/submission/21/9/neuralconnectsm.png","link":"submission/21/9"},{"title":"Network Mapping \"Visual Intelligence\" with the NodeXL Pro INSIGHTS Dashboard","image":"assets/content/submission/21/10/nmvisualintelsm.png","link":"submission/21/10"},{"title":"ecocalypse","image":"assets/content/submission/21/11/ecocalypsesm.png","link":"submission/21/11"},{"title":"POSLEDOVANIE","image":"assets/content/submission/21/12/posledovaniesm.png","link":"submission/21/12"},{"title":"Insertion Loss","image":"assets/content/submission/21/13/insertionlosssm.png","link":"submission/21/13"},{"title":"Latent Xylella","image":"assets/content/submission/21/14/latentxylellasm.png","link":"submission/21/14"},{"title":"A000000000001000AA011","image":"assets/content/submission/21/15/a0000sm.png","link":"submission/21/15"},{"title":"Error as Mother","image":"assets/content/submission/21/16/errormothersm.png","link":"submission/21/16"},{"title":"Yet We Laugh","image":"assets/content/submission/21/17/yetwelaughsm.png","link":"submission/21/17"},{"title":"Blooming Devices","image":"assets/content/submission/21/18/bloomingsm.png","link":"submission/21/18"},{"title":"Breath of Thought","image":"assets/content/submission/21/19/breathofthoughtsm.jpg","link":"submission/21/19"},{"title":"The Emotional Echo of Cultural Intelligence","image":"assets/content/submission/21/20/emotionalechosm.png","link":"submission/21/20"},{"title":"MATERIALIVE","image":"assets/content/submission/21/21/materialivesm.png","link":"submission/21/21"},{"title":"Abel & I","image":"assets/content/submission/21/22/abel-ism.png","link":"submission/21/22"},{"title":"Responsibility: Visualising AI for GoogleDeepmind","image":"assets/content/submission/21/23/responsibilitysm.png","link":"submission/21/23"},{"title":"Mind","image":"assets/content/submission/21/24/mindsm.png","link":"submission/21/24"},{"title":"Cyber Fungi","image":"assets/content/submission/21/25/cyberfungism.jpg","link":"submission/21/25"},{"title":"INVERSION 2 (Techno Optimism)","image":"assets/content/submission/21/26/inversion2sm.jpg","link":"submission/21/26"},{"title":"OpenAlex Mapper","image":"assets/content/submission/21/27/openalexmappersm.png","link":"submission/21/27"},{"title":"Urban Choreographies","image":"assets/content/submission/21/28/urbanchoreographiessm.png","link":"submission/21/28"},{"title":"ReCollection: You Only Have Seven Seconds","image":"assets/content/submission/21/29/recollectionsm.png","link":"submission/21/29"},{"title":"Dimensional Fluction V 0.1.1","image":"assets/content/submission/21/30/dimensionalfluctionsm.jpg","link":"submission/21/30"}],"iteration":21,"slug":"submissionIteration/21","directory":""},{"title":"XX. 20th Iteration Submissions","body":"<!--StartFragment-->\n\nThe *Places & Spaces: Mapping Science* exhibit is designed to open people’s minds and hearts to the value, complexity, and beauty of science and technology. We are inviting authors of interactive data visualizations, also called macroscopes, to submit their work for inclusion in the *Places & Spaces: Mapping Science* exhibit.\n\nThis collection of interactive visualizations will provide a glimpse into the future: a time when larger and more complex datasets are available, multi-factor analysis becomes commonplace, user interfaces are easier to use, and interactive visualizations routinely facilitate creative problem solving. Perhaps they incorporate datasets or methods of analysis from multiple disciplines. Or perhaps they demonstrate what kind of societal impact is made possible by influential interactive visualizations. Show us the future of interactive visualizations by submitting your work to this final iteration of macroscopes in the *Places & Spaces: Mapping Science* exhibit. \n\nMacroscopes are software tools that help us focus on patterns in data that are too large or complex to see with the naked eye. The term “macroscope” was explored in 1979 by Joël de Rosnay in a book titled *The Macroscope: A New World Scientific System* \\[1]. To meet the challenges posed by the rapidly increasing abundance, diversity, and complexity of information, de Rosnay proposes the “macroscope,” a tool for observing “what is at once too great, too slow, and too complex for our eyes.”\n\n*Places & Spaces* is a traveling exhibit that currently features 100 maps and 36 interactive macroscopes from a wide range of disciplines. Since 2005, the exhibit has traveled to 30 countries and appeared in various formats at over 458 venues and events, including the Davos Economic Forum, National Academy of Sciences, and the New York Public Library. News coverage has appeared in *Nature*, *Science*, *USA Today*, and *Wired*.\n\n##### References\n\n\\[1] de Rosnay, Joël. 1979. *The Macroscope: A New World Scientific System*.
