They empower individuals to interact with data and to make their very own maps. This iteration features macroscopes that:\n\n*   Track wind speed, temperature, pollution, and weather patterns in real time and worldwide.\n*   Organize 20 years of reports from four major research institutions, grouping and arranging them based on topics, popularity, and publication date.\n*   Illustrate connections between countries based on local news stories in more than 100 languages.\n*   Chart the movements of people and changing cultural influences by tracking the birth and death locations of 120,000 individuals over the past 2,600 years.",

    "body": "The world is complex. Macroscopes help us understand and manage that complexity. They are visual lenses we can use to focus on patterns and trends in large volumes of data.\n\n  \n\nThese four macroscopes use data that varies tremendously in terms of subject matter and method of collection: city smells derived from social media, a library collection mapped in time and space, institutional partnerships revealed through publications, and ship locations tracked by satellite. However, they each present data visually to make new perspectives possible.",

    "body": "If you are lost in the details of a problem, some say you cannot see the forest for the trees. Macroscopes, however, allow you to view both the forest and the trees. Macroscopes can even provide a view of that forest from outer space, and then zoom in to show you one individual leaf. The macroscopes in this iteration are especially good at conveying a sense of scale and navigating through data at different scales. They include some of the largest data sets imaginable, like the cosmos and the history of the world. Yet, they also let you focus on an individual detail, like the most important paper in one scientistâ€™s career.",

Each of these macroscopes provides a glimpse into data on a topic of great importance to our collective well-being.\n\n  \n\nHow we handle climate change, feed our bodies, address public health emergencies, and prevent violence have huge implications for human survival. Use these four macroscopes to explore the data behind the headlines, to develop a deeper understanding of each issue, and perhaps to devise creative solutions for the problems we face together.",

This iteration highlights different methods for analyzing and visualizing a dataset: scrollytelling, network analysis, dimensionality reduction, and natural language processing. Each can be used to create data portals of great power, utility, and beauty.",
