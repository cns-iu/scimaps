They empower individuals to interact with data and to make their very own maps. This iteration features macroscopes that:\n\n*   Track wind speed, temperature, pollution, and weather patterns in real time and worldwide.\n*   Organize 20 years of reports from four major research institutions, grouping and arranging them based on topics, popularity, and publication date.\n*   Illustrate connections between countries based on local news stories in more than 100 languages.\n*   Chart the movements of people and changing cultural influences by tracking the birth and death locations of 120,000 individuals over the past 2,600 years.",

They are visual lenses we can use to focus on patterns and trends in large volumes of data.\n\n  \n\nThese four macroscopes use data that varies tremendously in terms of subject matter and method of collection: city smells derived from social media, a library collection mapped in time and space, institutional partnerships revealed through publications, and ship locations tracked by satellite. However, they each present data visually to make new perspectives possible.",

Macroscopes can even provide a view of that forest from outer space, and then zoom in to show you one individual leaf. The macroscopes in this iteration are especially good at conveying a sense of scale and navigating through data at different scales. They include some of the largest data sets imaginable, like the cosmos and the history of the world. Yet, they also let you focus on an individual detail, like the most important paper in one scientist’s career.",

Use these four macroscopes to explore the data behind the headlines, to develop a deeper understanding of each issue, and perhaps to devise creative solutions for the problems we face together.",

Placing data in space gives us a sense of the proportion, distribution, and structure of a social problem. It can also help us find our own location within the data. Does where you were born affect your income later in life? How different are police methods in your state from others? Did past evaluations of the racial composition of your neighborhood increase or decrease the value of your home? How many copies of the COVID-19 virus could fit across the width of one strand of your hair? By placing complicated problems in a spatial context, these macroscopes can help us map out effective approaches to solving them. ",

Looking at income segregation at the level of the individual visitor within the landscape captures the dimension of movement. A shift in perspective can result in a richer and more multifaceted understanding of the subject at hand, whether that subject is egg shape or the motion of the stars.",
