    "body": "A recent screening of the award-winning [Humanexus](http://yfshen.info/humanexus/index.html), a thought-provoking film produced by [Katy Börner](https://luddy.indiana.edu/contact/profile/index.html?Katy_B%C3%B6rner), Victor H. Yngve Distinguished Professor of Engineering and Information Science at the [Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering](https://luddy.indiana.edu/), plus panel discussions with [Lisa-Marie Napoli,](https://pace.indiana.edu/about/staff/napoli-lisa-marie.html) director of IU’s Political and Civic Engagement program, and [Keith Barton,](https://education.indiana.edu/about/directory/profiles/barton-keith-c.html) professor at the IU School of Education, moderated by [Sarah Junk Hatcher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-hatcher-45a3a9b/), learning and community engagement manager at the Indiana University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, led to these questions that remain as relevant today as they were at the dawn of civilization:\n\nIs this the future we want?\n\nWhat do we want?\n\nCan we civilly talk about it?\n\nThe civil discourse panel discussion with Börner, Napoli, Barton and Hatcher that followed the screening at the Indiana University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology offered hope.\n\n“We need to have these discussions so people can get together and make informed decisions that result in futures which are desirable for all of us,” Börner said.\n\nThe film, directed by artist [Ying-Fang Shen](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/j7rs7ee55vwtcda7r3uru/_CV_2021_art.pdf?rlkey=1797dxbbfor18vntk0xhi4v2d&e=1&dl=0), won more than 50 film awards, including third place at the prestigious Aviff Cannes Art Film Festival in France in 2014. It uses animation to visualize human communication from the Stone Age to today. It explores the evolution of communication, and how media ranging from storytelling to the Internet have shaped knowledge exchange, and it highlights the communication opportunities and risks in this ever-increasing connected world.\n\nBörner discussed the inspiration for the film, the challenges in making it (“It’s hard to talk about communication through the ages.”) and how today’s technology, including AI, would have impacted its creation. She added that it’s “wonderful” that the film continues to be screened.\n\nFuture panel discussions as part of the museum’s mission to share the human stories behind its artifacts and the cultures that created them are planned.\n\nBörner also addressed the challenges of communicating between different academic disciplines, cultures and communities.\n\n“Today, there are many global challenges that require efficient interdisciplinary, inter-institutional, and inter-generational communication,” she said. “Having shared goals makes it possible to align good forces, make everyone comfortable and productive, and accomplish tasks that no team alone could complete.”\n\nNapoli stressed civil discourse involves communicating while showing common respect for people as “we navigate tensions.” It’s a way to increase knowledge and awareness, particularly with civic issues and the community. Actions in response to problems always have pros and cons, she said, and there are no easy solutions.\n\n“There’s a perception that we have to be directive and demanding or fully accommodating with each other to make progress in decision making, when in fact there is so much more in between those extremes that is key to consider,” she said. “The way we communicate is so vital.”\n\nBarton said it’s often a delicate balance between maintaining relationships with people and dealing with difficult issues.\n\n“As a society, we haven’t balanced that very well,” he said.\n\nAnd yet, people have productive conversations all the time, he added, but tend to focus on the unproductive ones.\n\n“People come together when they have common interests,” Barton said, “but it’s human nature to remember the conversations that went wrong rather than the 100 that went right.”\n\nWhile advanced communication technology can’t change that, hope for civil discourse remains. Börner invited readers to watch Humanexus so that they can answer for themselves, “What do we want?”",

Yngve Professor of Engineering and Information Science, at Indiana University’s [Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Museum of Art.](https://artmuseum.indiana.edu/)\n\nArtists, scientists, and data engineers gathered to view a collection of artworks, paired with their natural inspirations, that showcased multiple ways that art, science, and engineering can be motivated by an appreciation for biological processes and the beauty of the natural world across multiple scales.\n\nThe exhibits are currently displayed on the fourth floor of Luddy Hall.\n\n“Collaborations across art, science, and engineering lead to innovations that are larger than the sum of parts,” Börner said. “That makes it possible to tackle the grand challenges we are facing so we all live desirable futures.”\n\nBörner and her team at the [Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center](https://cns.iu.edu/) research, develop, and serve innovative methods and tools to model and visualize data from science, technology, biomedicine, education, and public policy.\n\nThat’s highlighted by their seven-year development of the [Human Reference Atlas](https://humanatlas.io/), a source of harmonized biological data designed to help biologists better understand health and disease, guide pharmacological development, and increase our understanding of how human bodies function.\n\nBörner’s presentation featured impressive work such as *CeCe and Squiggy* by Todd N. Theriault, Melanie B. Goldstone and Shouvik Maiti; *Capillus Linus (Hair Line)* by Carrie Longley; *Tabula Floris* by Luke Nikolov; *Beauty is Everywhere* by Angela Caldwell; and *Molecular Galaxy* by Beata Edyta Mierzwa.\n\n[Theriault](https://luddy.indiana.edu/contact/profile/index.html?Todd_Theriault) is a technical writer for the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center. [Maiti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shouvik-maiti/) is an IU Data Science student. Goldstone is a freelance UX designer based in Germany. [Longley](https://east.iu.edu/gallery/people.php) is an assistant professor of Fine Art at Indiana University East. [Nikolov](https://biology.indiana.edu/about/faculty/nikolov-luke.html) is an IU assistant professor of Biology. [Caldwell](https://eskenazi.indiana.edu/faculty/directory/caldwell-angela.html) is a visiting assistant professor of metalsmithing and jewelry design at IU. [Mierzwa](https://beatascienceart.com/about/) is a molecular biologist at the University of California San Diego and the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research.\n\nBörner, whose research explores the frontiers of data visualization, said the presentation led to a fascinating discussion that “provided fertile ground for developing future collaborations.”",
