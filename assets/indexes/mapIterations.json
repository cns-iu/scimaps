    "body": "The first iteration of this exhibit aims to show the power of maps to help understand, navigate, and manage both physical places and abstract knowledge spaces.  \n  \nThe first maps of our planet were neither complete nor entirely accurate. Yet, they were invaluable for navigation, exploration, and communication. They helped explorers avoid monsters and find promising lands. Maps of science developed today are not perfectly precise either since they are generated based on only a small portion of humanity’s scholarly knowledge. The generation of comprehensive and accurate maps requires the proper interlinkage of multilingual, multidisciplinary, and multimedia scholarly knowledge.  \n  \nNote that each of the six early maps of science displayed uses a different metaphor. What metaphor is most effective in designing a visual index of humanity’s knowledge and expertise?",

    "body": "The second iteration aims to inspire discussion about a common reference system for all of humanity’s scholarly knowledge.  \n  \nThroughout history, scientists have struggled to reach agreement upon standardized reference systems for their respective fields of research. The results include the electromagnetic spectrum, the periodic table of elements, geographic projections, and the celestial reference systems, all of which appear in this iteration. These standards are invaluable for indexing, storing, accessing, and managing scientific data efficiently.  \n  \nShown in comparison are six potential reference systems for scholarly knowledge. Each reference system—from the one-dimensional timeline, to the geospatial system, to the semantic system—could be used to identify the location of an author, paper, patent, or grant. This would highlight the dynamics of an author’s, institution’s, or country’s contributions or the impact of a particular work.",

Computational models of the movements of tectonic plates help reduce losses due to earthquakes, volcanic activity, or tsunamis. Economic models let us simulate either catastrophic or sustainable futures for humanity. Epidemic models allow us to understand how interconnected we all are and how actions far away affect us right here.  \n  \nDaily science and technology forecasts would show science maps with overlays of top experts, institutions, countries, major activity bursts, or emerging research frontiers augmenting our knowledge and decision-making capabilities. Given the importance of such forecasts, one might question why they are not available on TV, in the press, or online.",
